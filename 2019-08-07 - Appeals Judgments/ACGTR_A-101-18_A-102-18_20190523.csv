3042.700,3044.300,en-us,0.45603,,1," I'm sorry. Yeah."
3047.400,3053.400,en-us,0.58434,,1," amount of the penalty one must apply for two children"
3054.500,3060.000,en-us,0.75307,,1," Before it has been determined that the case committed. This is an nominee. Okay."
3061.700,3064.000,en-us,0.70251,,2," and everybody has said it's an enemy but"
3065.000,3074.000,en-us,0.79292,,2," Well, it may be an anomaly. I am referring to starway at my authority page 44 and 45."
3078.200,3080.100,en-us,0.52979,,2," They're just 27 and 28."
3080.100,3080.700,en-us,0.52979,,1," Okay"
3080.700,3081.900,en-us,0.52979,,2," start with"
3085.500,3089.600,en-us,0.32107,,1," 20 seconds"
3096.300,3098.900,en-us,0.58800,,2," 44"
3104.200,3120.500,en-us,0.48010,,2," That's that's an ordinary National. The only special rolling pose. Was that whether Mr. Start with it or not? Just kidding first of all."
3122.100,3128.000,en-us,0.69905,,2," I will deal with this a little later. The amount of penalty is not an issue. This is a child mother paper review."
3133.500,3138.900,en-us,0.85508,,1," Yes, and where does he say that you can dispute the penalty?"
3139.900,3140.700,en-us,0.92863,,1," In an action"
3140.700,3148.500,en-us,0.92863,,2," the next paragraph paragraph 28 begins with the next issue the position of the penalty not the amount of the road."
3150.000,3154.000,en-us,0.85316,,2," The defendant submit that at best I can only declare and so on and so on."
3155.700,3165.800,en-us,0.79883,,2," At the end of the paragraph the paragraph 28 Star Wars says since there was no infraction of the Customs act it follows that defendants cannot keep the amount forfeit."
3165.800,3170.800,en-us,0.79883,,1," Yeah, but that's a different question. I was talking to you about the amount of dependents."
3172.000,3176.900,en-us,0.69110,,1," I know that in your action, you do discuss that the amount was reduced by the minister."
3178.100,3178.200,en-us,0.30671,,1," three"
3187.700,3194.200,en-us,0.71270,,1," once there is no contraction. What can you do? Obviously, there's no contributions. There's no control"
3194.200,3205.100,en-us,0.71270,,2," your others that the defendant states that the only available remedy for you for the court is to declare what it was will not contribute."
3207.500,3208.500,en-us,0.76213,,2," He specifically says"
3208.500,3216.600,en-us,0.76213,,1," I didn't know nothing else, but you were going with okay. So you're trying to say under 135. What are the remnants?"
3217.400,3221.300,en-us,0.94293,,1," But what we're looking at now is whether you can."
3221.900,3224.800,en-us,0.56929,,1," Be very cute and application."
3226.900,3231.200,en-us,0.89508,,1," Or an ordinary action to contest the amount of dependent."
3232.600,3234.000,en-us,0.73900,,2," Well, they are"
3234.000,3238.100,en-us,0.73900,,1," but there's an issue"
3238.100,3240.400,en-us,0.73900,,2," it is a client."
3241.400,3243.300,en-us,0.78308,,2," I would like to point out ACL."
3245.100,3250.500,en-us,0.74711,,1," I'm not I have to say I'm not 100% I just want to make sure we get your point on this."
3250.500,3254.700,en-us,0.74711,,2," I would like to point out to ACL as another example where"
3260.200,3263.300,en-us,0.71495,,1," bringing it back to your"
3267.000,3267.000,en-us,0.29358,,1," part"
3268.400,3269.200,en-us,0.84319,,2," I'm saying that."
3270.100,3271.000,en-us,0.86814,,2," just because"
3272.500,3276.800,en-us,0.63075,,2," a claim under Section 135 discontinued within an ordinary option. Yes."
3277.600,3283.500,en-us,0.90805,,2," There is no provision in the Customs act to make it the exclusive claim that can be made in that ordinary action,"
3283.500,3283.900,en-us,0.90805,,1," right?"
3283.900,3291.500,en-us,0.90805,,2," There's no the customers that itself does not limit does not say that you may not have another claim that is related to"
3291.500,3294.600,en-us,0.90805,,1," the same time. And what's not clear is"
3296.300,3300.000,en-us,0.65197,,1," if it is clear in customary."
3301.200,3305.800,en-us,0.91483,,1," certain issues need to be dealt with by judicial review"
3308.700,3309.800,en-us,0.71139,,1," certain decision"
3316.100,3322.300,en-us,0.90733,,1," That's that's the problem. I'm trying to eliminate. Is there anything in your plane?"
3323.300,3331.700,en-us,0.89651,,1," That would be comparable to the planes that were made in the two cases on which their Church relies."
3336.100,3342.900,en-us,0.68709,,2," Which is just staring. Yes, there are multiple multiple claims multiple clamps in the same options."
3343.700,3347.300,en-us,0.90892,,1," Is there any of those planes in your action?"
3348.300,3352.500,en-us,0.84276,,1," That are the same as the planes that were dealt with in Star Wars and"
3352.500,3355.400,en-us,0.84276,,2," New Year. Well, they're not the same claims."
3356.200,3357.200,en-us,0.81119,,1," Not same"
3357.200,3359.200,en-us,0.81119,,2," at the same time."
3359.200,3363.400,en-us,0.81119,,1," I think that's the point that you you want to make."
3364.300,3370.200,en-us,0.93068,,1," It's not what is dealt with in those cases was something that needed to be done by application."
3370.800,3372.000,en-us,0.83219,,1," not by actions"
3373.000,3387.400,en-us,0.77553,,2," we were to discuss the if I could if I were to address this issue of application versus action the Customs does not even require the amount of people just good by way of about the issue."
3387.400,3388.100,en-us,0.77553,,1," Yes, but that's"
3390.200,3391.200,en-us,0.87594,,1," that's what it's supposed to be."
3392.000,3396.000,en-us,0.51480,,1," This decision have to be about federal office."
3407.900,3413.400,en-us,0.55417,,1," But all this must be done, you know, there can be a conversion if you want wet damages from that decision."
3413.400,3419.100,en-us,0.55417,,2," And this is why I was pointing to ACL kind of so,"
3419.100,3419.700,en-us,0.55417,,1," yeah."
3430.400,3431.400,en-us,0.28021,,1,"fish 42"
3434.200,3442.100,en-us,0.81610,,2," here in ACL the judge looked at section 135 claim and concluded at airglass 61."
3442.100,3443.000,en-us,0.81610,,1," Yes"
3443.000,3446.000,en-us,0.81610,,2," third line from the bottom that"
3447.300,3453.400,en-us,0.90243,,2," under the section 135 the flame the Vintage action and this regard must be dismissed."
3454.700,3455.900,en-us,0.88003,,2," within that regard"
3455.900,3457.200,en-us,0.88003,,1," which Regard"
3457.200,3459.300,en-us,0.88003,,2," in regard to section 135"
3489.800,3490.400,en-us,0.65749,,1," Okay, so"
3491.500,3495.500,en-us,0.54397,,1," why is that of interest to us? It seems to confirm with the judge was saying"
3495.500,3498.600,en-us,0.54397,,2," it's just so under 35 135."
3499.600,3508.200,en-us,0.88466,,2," That specific claim can be dismissed. However, he went on to consider the claim under 1:33 and following paragraph paragraph 60."
3510.400,3512.300,en-us,0.72262,,2," Actually the second following paragraph"
3512.300,3519.700,en-us,0.72262,,1," 93 and also clean and declaration and it is in tactical to retainment and return of the forfeit himself."
3529.500,3529.700,en-us,0.54539,,1," and"
3529.700,3530.500,en-us,0.54539,,2," 63"
3533.400,3535.100,en-us,0.63606,,1," and it's a leader as a matter."
3547.900,3551.700,en-us,0.72914,,2," Of 35 does not give them."
3552.600,3560.200,en-us,0.79706,,1," That's right. And he says either 135 or otherwise under the act or the general jurisdiction of the Court."
3561.200,3563.700,en-us,0.87351,,2," which which means that if if"
3566.300,3572.800,en-us,0.85871,,2," A relief thought was within the general jerk editions of the course. He would he would have to consider it."
3575.400,3580.900,en-us,0.90884,,2," He did not consider the that relief only because he was concerning section one."
3582.500,3582.900,en-us,0.92776,,2," 33"
3582.900,3585.700,en-us,0.92776,,1," but you were relying on a passage."
3586.300,3598.600,en-us,0.93697,,1," Where you said the judge confirmed that the court could give could make an order or for that. There's no money for people that was the previous case that you called."
3599.700,3607.300,en-us,0.73537,,1," And now they're saying we don't have that jurisdiction. So these two cases will have to go and look at okay."
3613.100,3619.300,en-us,0.78246,,2," if another if another remedy within the"
3620.800,3627.100,en-us,0.64868,,2," Action was within the general jurisdiction of the tradition of the Court. He would have to consider it."
3627.100,3636.700,en-us,0.64868,,1," Yes. He says it's not within the jurisdiction for 50 that's come directly to what you just said before"
3636.700,3638.800,en-us,0.64868,,2," that's specific claim you are right,"
3638.800,3641.400,en-us,0.64868,,1," you know, what will be there because"
3642.200,3643.100,en-us,0.44875,,2," I found"
3643.100,3649.100,en-us,0.44875,,1," that we should be distinguishing to start."
3651.400,3659.900,en-us,0.86791,,1," You know, no I'm not let me just finish my thought your I think saying that the judge was wrong and in."
3660.600,3663.000,en-us,0.73428,,1," Losing those two cases through a lot of fun."
3663.800,3668.100,en-us,0.88164,,1," Because of your case is differently, it can be distinguished and you're relying on ACL."
3668.900,3670.200,en-us,0.97836,,1," to say that the court has"
3671.000,3675.600,en-us,0.92120,,1," more jurisdiction to deal with these matters. Is that is that what it is"
3675.600,3679.700,en-us,0.92120,,2," it is however in in"
3683.100,3687.600,en-us,0.74841,,2," yes, so we based on ACL the port does have more services addition to consider."
3688.500,3689.200,en-us,0.91070,,1," your clients"
3689.900,3692.700,en-us,0.55227,,2," Visitors section one is 33 which is additional clients."
3692.700,3693.000,en-us,0.55227,,1," Okay,"
3693.000,3695.600,en-us,0.55227,,2," so I want to make sure I understand your points. Okay?"
3697.800,3711.900,en-us,0.51320,,2," There's one which is a page 45. It would continue on reading his family after we talked about he pointed out these he says the money he can't keep the money that there's no one fraction."
3713.200,3713.400,en-us,0.47398,,1," Then"
3713.400,3717.400,en-us,0.47398,,2," kind of playing on his self-portrait. There's allocation should be returned."
3718.500,3721.000,en-us,0.71402,,2," Now, so was it just over your comments in"
3721.000,3721.200,en-us,0.71402,,1," the judge?"
3721.900,3726.000,en-us,0.71965,,2," Or do you have to order the money thing? Because they have to have the judgment."
3727.500,3737.700,en-us,0.85537,,2," That will go on and even though they may not have jurisdiction to deal with something just point out the Trap as long as my decision. You really should do something even though it may not be able to order you to do something."
3740.800,3743.100,en-us,0.92036,,2," I don't know if there was an order or"
3744.700,3749.200,en-us,0.85489,,2," it was just not well the seems to be logical thing you really"
3749.200,3749.700,en-us,0.85489,,1," should do."
3751.100,3752.800,en-us,0.50326,,1," So we'll look at that. What?"
3762.300,3768.300,en-us,0.67566,,2," I would like post a point out and paragraph 63 of ACL."
3771.000,3771.600,en-us,0.43492,,1," the judge did"
3773.900,3784.100,en-us,0.56277,,2," towards the end hate hands with I conclude that in order should go setting aside the minister determination made under section one, but his face and referring both Myers back for"
3784.100,3784.900,en-us,0.56277,,1," restoration"
3784.900,3786.400,en-us,0.56277,,2," by another judicator."
3787.400,3791.300,en-us,0.83785,,2," So that means that even in an action in an ordinary action."
3793.500,3795.200,en-us,0.66449,,2," Section 133 was good,"
3795.200,3803.900,en-us,0.66449,,1," you know what would read the case because that's why normally you shouldn't have a page like this. We don't have to have the whole case here have it all."
3804.900,3808.300,en-us,0.86482,,1," Before but we'll look at so that's your third."
3810.100,3812.800,en-us,0.86712,,1," What else do you want to say about 102?"
3819.800,3821.500,en-us,0.67415,,2," about jointer"
3824.700,3825.500,en-us,0.81655,,2," It's again."
3825.500,3826.200,en-us,0.81655,,1," It's"
3830.100,3833.100,en-us,0.62891,,1," six of your rules"
3834.600,3837.200,en-us,0.49849,,2," Well, there's no claim of underwater systems."
3837.200,3842.500,en-us,0.49849,,1," I'm talking about the rules. You're not talking."
3842.500,3846.400,en-us,0.49849,,2," Yes, that will want to want."
3851.700,3852.400,en-us,0.15433,,2," to"
3858.800,3860.700,en-us,0.62239,,1," subject to"
3860.700,3868.400,en-us,0.62239,,2," rules to a party to my request really good against another party as interesting in respect of more than one client."
3868.400,3869.000,en-us,0.62239,,1," Yes."
3872.300,3878.600,en-us,0.79581,,2," So it would be incorrect. So it was a palpable number right here for for the motion injection."
3879.600,3886.700,en-us,0.93469,,2," To disallow this Rule and claimed that only a section 135 claim can be made in an ordinary action."
3887.800,3891.400,en-us,0.87435,,2," when the rules of thrill Court obviously say otherwise"
3898.900,3899.500,en-us,0.80408,,1," anything else"
3906.900,3907.500,en-us,0.62659,,2," Yes."
3910.500,3911.400,en-us,0.85005,,1," You're going very well."
3922.200,3923.600,en-us,0.34943,,2," You're right."
3923.600,3927.600,en-us,0.34943,,1," Yeah, that's why that's"
3933.000,3939.300,en-us,0.49172,,2," just to a party may occur the court May order separate clamps."
3940.200,3945.300,en-us,0.70480,,2," Or many orders that came to be split or to be dealt with in a more convenient fashion."
3945.300,3948.200,en-us,0.70480,,1," So with your saying is they should have split it."
3949.000,3952.800,en-us,0.64453,,1," If you thought that this was completed as a dismissal,"
3952.800,3953.400,en-us,0.64453,,2," that's right."
3953.400,3953.900,en-us,0.64453,,1," Okay."
3958.700,3965.200,en-us,0.85616,,2," Because just ignoring and and the spacing claims without looking at them. There's no justice in that."
3966.700,3968.000,en-us,0.76901,,2," it's not an interest or just"
3968.900,3969.400,en-us,0.57196,,1," okay."
3973.400,3974.400,en-us,0.94979,,2," I'd like to point out."

5376.700,5387.200,en-us,0.79981,,1," is adapted in part nine. So subtraction 1:23. So what you're saying, it applies only to the part or wherever it says that it applies. That"

6202.700,6205.200,en-us,0.71928,,1," 15 is the rule for the summer third,"
6205.200,6205.500,en-us,0.71928,,2," right?"
6206.100,6206.200,en-us,0.76360,,1," So"
6207.300,6207.900,en-us,0.76621,,1," and"
6210.500,6222.300,en-us,0.88358,,1," frankly, I have some difficulty and that's why I'm raising it just speaking for myself at this stage and we decided in anything but I have some difficulty with the argument."
6225.200,6227.200,en-us,0.82389,,1," You cannot add an action."
6230.200,6231.700,en-us,0.84051,,1," parts"
6234.400,6234.800,en-us,0.55768,,1," purpose"
6241.400,6257.500,en-us,0.83123,,1," rather than remove them and separate them as different action there. You would have to mold maybe bring emotion to strike on the 2.1."
6258.400,6260.800,en-us,0.63958,,1," Either because no reason no cost. No children."
6266.600,6277.200,en-us,0.83324,,1," I just can't understand why you say I'm going to try other things just because you feel that 135 should be on its own."
6278.500,6281.600,en-us,0.86851,,1," The crown like substance over form over substance"
6281.600,6291.100,en-us,0.86851,,2," the crown did bring emotion to strike and that was dismissed by proprietary motion ski, she suggested that there's motion for some regiments."
6292.300,6298.100,en-us,0.71308,,1," Respect to which portion of the action?"
6299.200,6309.100,en-us,0.92046,,2," Again, related to the question of law simply boiled down to whether the conduct an issue could be resolved by determining whether the coins are Goods or not."
6317.800,6320.800,en-us,0.80133,,2," Because that is the only conduct that was an issue in."
6321.800,6322.200,en-us,0.78184,,2," The plaintiff's"
6322.200,6324.400,en-us,0.78184,,1," claims,"
6324.400,6362.000,en-us,0.78184,,2," of course, the cling can be framed however, a plaintiff wishes and it can be very expensive particularly where things are acting in person. But nonetheless the only issues with the federal court will consider is the question of in this case whether the coins are goods and Justice League was very clear about that point that section the Customs act provides a very limited review in this. It's not really an ordinary action at all. It's a statutory appeal by way about"
6364.500,6365.300,en-us,0.42444,,1," keep to"
6366.000,6377.300,en-us,0.93876,,1," this would be the key question to all the planes because my question to you is not whether you can put them in the same proceeding which is procedural. Okay?"
6378.600,6382.800,en-us,0.94632,,1," What courts do when things are put together? That should not be put together?"
6384.400,6385.300,en-us,0.57416,,1," a separate them"
6386.200,6387.600,en-us,0.89722,,1," They don't just strike it."
6389.000,6394.000,en-us,0.82339,,1," Unless there is no mirror, but you have to have emotion nothing at the middle of the other stuff."
6394.700,6407.800,en-us,0.84740,,1," If you're saying to me and that's what I heard that this one question was determinative of all of the other plans. That's a different story, but I couldn't see it when I read."
6409.000,6415.600,en-us,0.72808,,1," Now it was not evident to me just because I didn't see it, you know."
6419.600,6422.200,en-us,0.75697,,1," That one question. Are you good?"
6423.500,6426.700,en-us,0.84973,,1," Is enough to determine the merits of all the other times?"
6427.900,6436.000,en-us,0.68637,,2," I take your point, but obviously Justice Gleason. Yes."
6436.000,6439.000,en-us,0.68637,,1," Okay, so that he thinks differently is another story"
6439.000,6449.000,en-us,0.68637,,2," and the crown submits that the only issue that was the required any review whatsoever. Whether it's by summary judgment or at a trial."
6450.300,6454.200,en-us,0.84283,,2," Claim was whether the goods are whether their coins are Goods."
6455.500,6461.200,en-us,0.92141,,1," I assume that you try to convince him of that. So now is your time to practice convince us of that."
6461.800,6462.900,en-us,0.88972,,1," But that's the point here"
6462.900,6467.400,en-us,0.88972,,2," if the coins are not good. They're then clearly the defendant loses the case."
6468.400,6471.400,en-us,0.77189,,2," It's full stop and if the coins are good."
6472.500,6476.600,en-us,0.88262,,2," What else is available to my friend under a statutory of this is not"
6476.600,6477.100,en-us,0.88262,,1," an actually."
6478.900,6493.400,en-us,0.80457,,1," What would you be losing?"
6495.100,6516.300,en-us,0.89998,,2," I think it's fair to say that Justice Gleason that there was no Prospect of success for those claims. There may not have been a specific motion before him at the time to strike those Clans emotion had as I said in brought previously to strike and have been dismissed."
6517.100,6518.200,en-us,0.71531,,1," So that's not very good for you."
6528.600,6529.400,en-us,0.97097,,1," so somebody"
6530.900,6532.600,en-us,0.75600,,1," in this case, is that Mr."
6535.700,6536.300,en-us,0.55266,,2," Oh sure"
6536.300,6538.600,en-us,0.55266,,1," has the right."
6539.400,6542.600,en-us,0.81514,,1," To present his argument as to whether to be strive."
6542.600,6543.700,en-us,0.81514,,2," Yes. So"
6543.700,6544.800,en-us,0.81514,,1," let's start from there."
6545.900,6566.300,en-us,0.80430,,2," If the court disagrees with Justice Gleason that those ancillary claims should not have been struck then if you if you follow through on that proposition, then you can make a determination on emotional for some reason whether the coins are goods and allow the rest of the things to proceed and set it back to federal court and rest assured like"
6566.300,6571.300,en-us,0.80430,,1," okay, but you see my point I do just wait."
6581.500,6583.600,en-us,0.67423,,1," here"
6607.600,6610.500,en-us,0.88984,,1," then we'd be fine, but I don't see how you"
6613.300,6617.600,en-us,0.92559,,1," I just and I'm not talking for my credit just me so convinced me."
6618.900,6622.100,en-us,0.95808,,1," You know if you think you can't but procedure."
6623.000,6624.900,en-us,0.76692,,1," You know, he hasn't 135."
6624.900,6625.500,en-us,0.76692,,2," Yes,"
6625.500,6632.900,en-us,0.76692,,1," and yes, I write of action maybe for damages and for whatnot. Maybe he's wrong. Okay."
6641.500,6655.000,en-us,0.77506,,2," Well that the coins are good. It's difficult to conceive that he would have a clean for Humanity of Damages because he hasn't alleged that he was mistreated in their way by border officers,"
6655.000,6655.600,en-us,0.77506,,1," Daniel."
6655.600,6657.800,en-us,0.77506,,2," Yes."
6657.800,6660.600,en-us,0.77506,,1," Okay now have you considered?"
6671.800,6676.400,en-us,0.56736,,1," He responsible for fraud."
6680.100,6682.700,en-us,0.92183,,1," So that would be easy for you to produce cases. Yes."
6684.200,6686.100,en-us,0.73035,,1," And last year as until June."
6688.500,6688.800,en-us,0.66787,,1," 6"
6688.800,6689.500,en-us,0.66787,,2," June"
6689.500,6692.000,en-us,0.66787,,1," 7th so many days do you need to"
6692.000,6696.200,en-us,0.66787,,2," as many as you relationships, but I don't need much time."
6696.200,6701.700,en-us,0.66787,,1," So an extra day because you'll start looking now, of course, so by the 9th,"
6701.700,6702.300,en-us,0.66787,,2," yes."
6750.100,6751.900,en-us,0.79467,,1," So, you know."
6753.000,6769.900,en-us,0.77196,,1," When we send it back, there may be a lot more hurdle under them reasonable cause of action on its face just because of the warning the communication and whatnot. Yes. Okay, you're all following on that."
6769.900,6770.800,en-us,0.77196,,2," I am. Yes,"
6770.800,6771.100,en-us,0.77196,,1," okay."
6772.900,6777.700,en-us,0.80385,,1," Okay. Now you want to say anything else about the Amendments or are you"
6777.700,6785.300,en-us,0.80385,,2," yes"
6785.300,6786.400,en-us,0.80385,,1," now?"
6792.100,6793.300,en-us,0.68926,,2," Can you show me where they work?"
6794.900,6818.000,en-us,0.74920,,2," They weren't stuck. It's just made the comments. So in fact, no that's right. They were not actually struck that he simply decided the issue about whether the coins are goods. And then of course whether they're points are currently and subject to his findings. He decided to dismiss the entire action."
6818.700,6819.900,en-us,0.59949,,2," with he didn't strike it"
6819.900,6821.600,en-us,0.59949,,1," he just"
6825.400,6827.800,en-us,0.91487,,1," You realize how it becomes very important."
6827.800,6837.900,en-us,0.91487,,2," Yes, you would have to find that the ruling on coins as goods and currency was determinative of all the claims in the plaintiff's claim."
6839.300,6841.600,en-us,0.86584,,1," or that procedure form"
6844.500,6844.800,en-us,0.73877,,2," Yes."
6845.600,6851.700,en-us,0.72041,,1," You override the substance and you can just because you haven't put it on in the same state."
6851.700,6852.600,en-us,0.72041,,2," Yes."
6862.200,6862.400,en-us,0.77568,,1," So"
6862.400,6876.900,en-us,0.77568,,2," in the federal court, the crown of the position of the coins are Goods Justice Gleason found that they are both goes in currency and a lot of appeal to this court. The crown is having to support Justice Gleason's ruling on both those points."
6878.900,6904.100,en-us,0.69830,,2," The crown referred to settle pieces of legislation before Justice Gleason the crown repeat those submissions. But in addition the crown is rely on the Customs tariff, which I started in the memorandum as well as two cases decided under the federal export and important permits. Both are fairly old cases, but they made their point of"
6904.100,6904.900,en-us,0.69830,,1," okay."
6909.800,6925.200,en-us,0.86266,,1," In my own mind the first one I would like you to clarify if you can is the proposition that if something there's no tax to be paid. It doesn't need to be declared on yes. There's an obligation to declare under another act"
6925.200,6927.000,en-us,0.86266,,2," right that is not"
6927.000,6927.700,en-us,0.86266,,1," stuck with that."
6927.700,6939.700,en-us,0.86266,,2," But it's absolutely false if the broad during the trip to be declared it must be"
6940.200,6947.700,en-us,0.79274,,2," Absolutely must be reported. Even if there's no tax is to be paid on it in terms of custom duties because they need each."
6949.300,6953.200,en-us,0.63125,,1," Okay. So where do we have that provision that says if you exceed you?"
6953.200,6957.100,en-us,0.63125,,2," Yes 48 hours. That's all it is."
6957.100,6958.900,en-us,0.63125,,1," Where do we have that provision?"
6960.300,6965.000,en-us,0.73798,,2," So you're looking for the specific provision and the customers are"
6965.000,6966.600,en-us,0.73798,,1," yes, because you say that."
6971.100,6971.300,en-us,0.87935,,2," so"
6971.300,6972.700,en-us,0.87935,,1," yes,"
6972.700,6978.300,en-us,0.87935,,2," so I reproduced provisions of the Customs act that the end of my"
6979.400,6983.300,en-us,0.75929,,2," memorandum of but those particular Provisions would"
6984.700,6985.900,en-us,0.91761,,2," out in the regulations, which"
6986.600,6987.200,en-us,0.86516,,1," as you"
6987.200,6990.400,en-us,0.86516,,2," not believe I have reproduced in full."
6992.800,6996.100,en-us,0.87883,,2," So I would have to provide that to you subsequently."
6997.000,6998.800,en-us,0.75734,,1," We have the customer service."
7000.300,7000.400,en-us,0.68528,,2," Yes."
7001.300,7002.200,en-us,0.83337,,1," Exactly. Yeah,"
7002.200,7002.500,en-us,0.83337,,2," no"
7002.500,7006.500,en-us,0.83337,,1," because you do realize that that was one of his main artist."
7007.200,7007.300,en-us,0.78183,,1," throughout"
7009.600,7010.600,en-us,0.81438,,1," it's not an interior."
7010.600,7019.300,en-us,0.81438,,2," Well, it's a bit of a surprise argument for that. It's just because there is no Duty owing a good doesn't have to be reported."
7020.500,7031.700,en-us,0.66427,,2," For example, let's take it the keys out of this case. If the ghosts are currency if their value is an excessive 10,000 dollars"
7031.700,7032.800,en-us,0.66427,,1," Express seat."
7032.800,7035.800,en-us,0.66427,,2," Yes, they have to be reported but there's no taxable on those."
7035.800,7038.400,en-us,0.66427,,1," Yes, but I think what the shoes"
7038.400,7041.800,en-us,0.66427,,2," yes,"
7041.800,7046.400,en-us,0.66427,,1," there could be a series of other stations."
7053.400,7054.200,en-us,0.57781,,1," so"
7056.500,7061.400,en-us,0.91204,,1," We need something tangible other than it makes no it's false. So."
7063.100,7065.800,en-us,0.89714,,1," I thought that that argument was raised in the"
7067.300,7068.300,en-us,0.67143,,1," after announcement"
7070.100,7076.500,en-us,0.88304,,2," if it is, but I mean, are you asking for this citation to the regulation that"
7076.500,7078.100,en-us,0.88304,,1," I want a piece?"
7081.000,7082.800,en-us,0.74606,,2," There's no case."
7082.800,7083.500,en-us,0.74606,,1," Okay,"
7083.500,7101.900,en-us,0.74606,,2," what I could do what I can offer to the court is when the time comes from it and the case law on the Frog of the public servant I can provide as well to reference to the specific provision in the regulation that the deals with a specific limits."
7101.900,7106.000,en-us,0.74606,,1," We don't want to extend this if you could provide."
7128.400,7143.000,en-us,0.92082,,1," The second section will be whatever you have to say about the regulation that is being raised in the okay. This is not a memorandum. Okay, all this must not be more than five pages."
7143.700,7144.000,en-us,0.86663,,1," all"
7152.400,7153.500,en-us,0.83704,,1," I just want that to be put"
7193.800,7211.300,en-us,0.60472,,2," because he the plaintiff paid and this is called US dollars for these 5700 for these coins when in fact that represented 29.5 times their face value."
7212.300,7212.500,en-us,0.89128,,2," So"
7212.500,7220.600,en-us,0.89128,,1," so there's an obligation to disclose it just because it was over is exemption. Yes, whether or not there was definitely"
7223.200,7229.300,en-us,0.78000,,1," And are you going to address the urine deportation of those Provisions that if you push us through?"
7229.800,7230.000,en-us,0.71436,,2," Yes."
7234.100,7237.000,en-us,0.85830,,2," Unless you have any further questions. Those are always missions."
7239.500,7249.100,en-us,0.80220,,2," So the provisions that you asked about the regulations the limits."
7276.400,7290.500,en-us,0.75716,,2," well lady I have I mean I can take you through Justice Gleason's decision and detail, but the Supreme Court of Canada has said that you know, the"
7291.700,7297.100,en-us,0.84080,,2," Pellet report does not need to conduct the same analysis that was conducted by the federal."
7297.100,7299.300,en-us,0.84080,,1," Sorry. This is a question of milk."
7299.300,7301.100,en-us,0.84080,,2," Yes question of no. Yes."
7301.100,7305.100,en-us,0.84080,,1," Okay. So are we here that some question of North Korea's?"
7305.100,7305.500,en-us,0.84080,,2," Yes."
7305.500,7309.700,en-us,0.84080,,1," Okay, so why are not are we not conducting it ourselves?"
7311.400,7315.400,en-us,0.80080,,2," So his question was that Justice Gleason is arguments that Justice."
7319.700,7327.300,en-us,0.82302,,2," just because that particular section is not referred to expressly Injustice and the decision doesn't mean that that"
7328.300,7331.800,en-us,0.88985,,2," Legislation was cited to him act was before him."
7332.900,7333.500,en-us,0.79797,,2," he"
7335.000,7341.400,en-us,0.73022,,2," refer to numerous pieces of legislation in his decision dealing with currently."
7375.400,7380.500,en-us,0.84797,,1," So let's say you had drugs manure and decides to bring back its."
7381.700,7383.600,en-us,0.64445,,1," under 1000 and by the"

7400.600,7414.800,en-us,0.78644,,2," Refer to my memory and there's a picture of it at the back of my book of authorities. If you brought that and brought it into Canada, you would have to declare it as a good because purchased it. Well, the last time it was bought it was bought for 10 million dollars US."
7415.900,7424.100,en-us,0.69080,,2," You don't have to declare it under the proceeds of finding money longer. Yeah, because the face value is less than 10000 dollars Canadian."
7425.200,7434.700,en-us,0.77694,,2," Declared only as a good the proceeds Act only comes into play if the face value of the money that may or may not be longer is over 10,000 dollars."
7437.100,7451.800,en-us,0.84699,,1," And what about if that's right, then you can put to the bank or in your I'm just I'm just puzzled by the fact that you don't think that people have to declare."
7451.800,7452.500,en-us,0.84699,,2," Well"
7452.500,7456.700,en-us,0.84699,,1," the million dollar they bring in it's just because it's on Facebook."
7456.700,7470.200,en-us,0.84699,,2," Yes. I understand really the money laundering provisions of the process of climactic not apply to collectible coins that have a very low face value but a very high fair market value."
7471.000,7486.100,en-us,0.82781,,2," It's like bringing in diamonds. The proceeds act just doesn't apply in terms of money ordering even though a drug Smuggler or a terrorist can bring one diamond and it's easily over ten thousand dollars. It's different legislation that applies to catch that."
7487.200,7492.600,en-us,0.85421,,2," precedes Act only applies to the implication of actual currency and only"
7500.600,7502.000,en-us,0.77562,,2," I would have to check but I believe."
7507.700,7508.500,en-us,0.89353,,2," Well, no."
7509.800,7511.300,en-us,0.92997,,2," we have a judgment that"
7511.300,7512.900,en-us,0.92997,,1," based on that and we don't have we"
7512.900,7516.300,en-us,0.92997,,2," have the provision that is an issue whether but we don't have"
7517.800,7522.000,en-us,0.87813,,2," we don't have the entire act before the court in my in my local history."
7522.700,7523.700,en-us,0.73961,,1," And yeah, but"
7523.700,7525.500,en-us,0.73961,,2," yeah the specific provision."
7528.100,7539.600,en-us,0.70905,,1," So the reporting that if we know can react phase but"
7539.600,7543.900,en-us,0.70905,,2," it is understood by the Water Service officers that they are to buy that."
7550.900,7565.000,en-us,0.78129,,2," Yes, I mean it's suitable you could have old Canadian dollar bills that are worth much more than one dollar right now, but still with not be within the 10,000 11 without me over. They don't have to be declared."
7565.700,7574.500,en-us,0.82086,,2," Because of their Facebook but if the terrorists goes to sell it, you know and pains more than 10,000 dollars. Obviously. That's a problem."
7579.800,7589.200,en-us,0.85738,,1," Respect of the Declaration for good and money. Yes."
7590.300,7593.600,en-us,0.90520,,1," And you rely on your written submission?"
7593.600,7594.100,en-us,0.90520,,2," Yes."
7595.300,7595.800,en-us,0.85201,,1," And that's"
7595.800,7605.700,en-us,0.85201,,2," well look in terms of the question. You asked me did the Justice please and consider section 11 of the currency actors to take one of my friends arguments."
7606.400,7620.100,en-us,0.76630,,2," At paragraph 50 of Justice Gleason's reasons for decision the votes almost a page and a half of his reasons for decision to citing Section 8, for example, the Customs Act."
7620.800,7628.700,en-us,0.77796,,2," I simply want to raise the point that the game that he simply because he hasn't specifically cited section 11 doesn't mean he didn't"
7628.700,7630.700,en-us,0.77796,,1," considered."
7630.700,7632.300,en-us,0.77796,,2," Yes."
7655.200,7658.600,en-us,0.86886,,1," Yes, so is there something wrong in this video?"
7661.900,7662.300,en-us,0.75793,,2," No."
7664.000,7666.800,en-us,0.65324,,2," I don't think I'm following it. But"
7666.800,7675.600,en-us,0.65324,,1," let's look at paragraph 65 to judge is the plaintiff has not argued that the coins have found to be good. For example."
7681.500,7685.000,en-us,0.72354,,2," I see what your pointing as whether or not"
7685.000,7686.700,en-us,0.72354,,1," yes. Yes."
7686.700,7689.700,en-us,0.72354,,2," Absolutely accurate on that point."
7689.700,7690.600,en-us,0.72354,,1," I"
7690.600,7697.500,en-us,0.72354,,2," would have to take you to his notice his written representations file in response to the motion for summary judgment."
7697.500,7699.400,en-us,0.72354,,1," So let's look at"
7708.900,7714.600,en-us,0.56619,,1," That problem with my book on page."
7724.000,7725.400,en-us,0.47852,,2," factor for the people"
7725.400,7729.900,en-us,0.47852,,1," above value 1 in 102 Dash 18"
7735.700,7736.200,en-us,0.64820,,1," to look at"
7740.300,7743.600,en-us,0.87252,,1," I think you're saying it should be it should be page 121."
7745.300,7749.400,en-us,0.67349,,1," Okay that can you look at your book and it may be one page"
7749.400,7752.700,en-us,0.67349,,2," 1214."
7786.700,7787.400,en-us,0.50116,,1," No."
7793.700,7794.900,en-us,0.57124,,1," anyway"
7802.100,7804.000,en-us,0.75557,,1," Whether or not the judge accepted as if"
7804.000,7806.900,en-us,0.75557,,2," an issue exactly yes. Yes, that's the point of situation way"
7806.900,7812.900,en-us,0.75557,,1," and you don't have nine and tell us if you think it's the same argument that they've got 65"
7813.900,7816.400,en-us,0.83397,,1," because maybe it's not the same argument."
7822.700,7822.900,en-us,0.88973,,1," Well, the"
7822.900,7824.700,en-us,0.88973,,2," plaintiff has been admitted."
7825.200,7825.500,en-us,0.94680,,2," the evidence"
7826.200,7833.900,en-us,0.87695,,2," Is paid 5700 us for the points? So clearly that if the coins are good that would trigger the reporting requirements."
7854.800,7856.300,en-us,0.72727,,1," So what do we have at 9?"
7864.800,7868.500,en-us,0.81031,,1," But now we're talking about the difference in nine we're talking about."
7873.000,7874.700,en-us,0.92131,,1," which is a neighboring which"
7881.900,7885.400,en-us,0.62413,,1," you can section 12 1 of the question Act."
7886.000,7893.300,en-us,0.83913,,1," All Goods that are important shawl except in such circumstances subject that may be prescribed the reported to the news."
7894.200,7895.900,en-us,0.75439,,1," So all Goods that are important."
7897.700,7898.600,en-us,0.85734,,2," Yes, so"
7898.600,7900.700,en-us,0.85734,,1," you're saying that argument?"
7904.600,7907.600,en-us,0.84059,,2," I think that argument must have been made to the judge because the"
7908.400,7913.400,en-us,0.77946,,2," pleaded that he paid an amount and accessibility allowable limit not to report"
7913.400,7916.600,en-us,0.77946,,1," so we did Judge and spoke when he says the argument."
7919.100,7921.300,en-us,0.91483,,2," It's possible, but I don't see that anything turns"
7921.300,7921.500,en-us,0.91483,,1," out."
7923.000,7928.400,en-us,0.63524,,1," Okay, that's yes."
7928.400,7940.000,en-us,0.63524,,2," I didn't anticipate that the plaintiff is going to take issue with something on this with respect to this particular sentence in just"
7941.500,7942.700,en-us,0.72014,,2," That point in his memorandum."
7944.100,7947.100,en-us,0.75344,,1," Okay, so that board has nothing to remember and food."
7948.400,7949.100,en-us,0.79402,,1," and it's not"
7950.900,7952.700,en-us,0.88352,,2," Okay, I don't see anything turning on."
7966.300,7971.100,en-us,0.70144,,1," Okay. The next point was a paragraph 68."
7975.700,7981.300,en-us,0.71844,,1," The reference to the fact that there are overlapping for vision in itself shows."
7987.400,8001.600,en-us,0.77746,,2," Just the mere fact that they're open up does not mean that there's a conflict and what Justice Gleason did was review all of the different pieces of relevant legislation very clearly and crafts together."
8003.100,8008.400,en-us,0.79481,,2," The clear the clear proposition that could that point these collector coins are votes."
8009.800,8025.600,en-us,0.84795,,2," There was no easy answer for him. There was no definition of money in any of his eyes, but by looking at all of the piece of legislation, which he has carefully sited at length in his long decision. He found as a fact that points are Goods."
8026.700,8028.400,en-us,0.66790,,2," Yeah, that's a matter of law."
8028.400,8029.000,en-us,0.66790,,1," Yes."
8035.600,8036.700,en-us,0.78726,,1," There is no restructure."
8040.900,8043.900,en-us,0.88447,,1," Okay, the next point that was raised and"
8048.800,8056.800,en-us,0.57087,,1," the happiness argues that this question knowing was not a knot and the judge at also consider."
8058.700,8061.800,en-us,0.85250,,1," whether the decision under appeal was otherwise"
8063.900,8076.300,en-us,0.62971,,2," the federal court on the motion for southern was to the term and whether the coins were Goods or currency or both."
8077.300,8083.000,en-us,0.60829,,2," An outcome of that determination was determinate of the entire statutory appeal."
8084.400,8087.600,en-us,0.96046,,2," There was no need to allow any of the other claims to proceed."
8089.100,8090.600,en-us,0.60218,,2," And Justice League so far."
8094.400,8097.400,en-us,0.83548,,2," And the ministerial decision to be clear was not."
8098.500,8110.700,en-us,0.86601,,2," Technically something that he judicially reviewed. This is a statue of action. So Justice Gleason technically did not need to consider the ministerial decision Beyond its actual outcome"
8110.700,8111.800,en-us,0.86601,,1," because it's you know,"
8111.800,8112.200,en-us,0.86601,,2," yes."
8114.800,8115.900,en-us,0.69964,,1," What different evidence?"
8115.900,8116.400,en-us,0.69964,,2," Yes."
8119.500,8119.800,en-us,0.56906,,1," Okay."
8141.800,8155.900,en-us,0.71232,,2," Yes,"
8155.900,8157.100,en-us,0.71232,,1," so you're not"
8157.100,8157.800,en-us,0.71232,,2," no,"
8157.800,8158.600,en-us,0.71232,,1," okay."
8171.600,8174.500,en-us,0.78850,,1," Whatever the merits you have to go by the rules,"
8174.500,8174.800,en-us,0.78850,,2," absolutely."
8177.000,8179.000,en-us,0.71107,,1," Okay, I think."
8181.000,8188.900,en-us,0.66704,,1," We're talking when you type of the goods that have been reported you say there was ahead and reported with those internet of your attention."
8191.300,8197.900,en-us,0.72736,,1," Doctor said first referred to percentage of your personal limitation personal exemption."
8197.900,8209.700,en-us,0.72736,,2," Yes. Yes, that's true. But here the goods were clearly accessible. Yes, as a matter of law. Yes. The only time he has to report Goods is if it's over the I believe it's a hundred dollars. Okay."
8209.700,8218.800,en-us,0.72736,,1," Yes. I"
8218.800,8222.200,en-us,0.72736,,2," know that I have no I'm not bringing back anything that I have to"
8222.200,8222.700,en-us,0.72736,,1," declare."
8224.000,8232.400,en-us,0.70928,,2," You have to disclose that he's bought Goods, but they did not subject to the reporting requirements under the Customs. Act was the first person's Act."
8233.500,8235.000,en-us,0.47053,,1," Yes, see instead of buying."
8235.000,8239.300,en-us,0.47053,,2," Yes."
8240.700,8244.200,en-us,0.51098,,1," He wouldn't have happened."
8244.200,8245.200,en-us,0.51098,,2," No."
8246.400,8257.800,en-us,0.83911,,2," But technically to answer your question Lord, he would have had to say yes. I have bought Goods, but I have nothing to be quit. He couldn't simply say I have not purchased any good surge during"
8257.800,8261.400,en-us,0.83911,,1," my trip because on the form it says do you bring any good over the"
8261.400,8276.100,en-us,0.83911,,2," minute on the form? Yes, but if you're actually asked this was a land Crossing if you're asked by the Border Services officers squarely having purchased anything abroad technically. You should say I haven't purchased anything over that you"
8284.700,8287.200,en-us,0.84813,,2," that there are exemptions."
8288.300,8295.500,en-us,0.58950,,2," And I will provide those things actually provide exception to section 12. Yes."
8299.300,8303.500,en-us,0.85395,,2," You all have those exemptions when we travel abroad typically for alcohol. Everybody knows that."
8317.800,8322.200,en-us,0.78460,,1," And that's regardless of whether or not you're obliged to pay taxes."
8322.200,8322.400,en-us,0.78460,,2," Yes."
8324.100,8325.200,en-us,0.95330,,1," Because"
8325.200,8329.300,en-us,0.95330,,2," those exemptions did not apply to the plaintiff. I"
8330.100,8332.400,en-us,0.73420,,2," did not like authorities, but I will provide"
8332.400,8333.200,en-us,0.73420,,1," okay."
8343.700,8357.500,en-us,0.77095,,2," Like client is successful in this court. My client will ask for cost of the appeals but successful was divided in the court below so it would only be respect to the appeals and like when you have to have access to"
8381.200,8392.700,en-us,0.74203,,2," have to concede that's success would be divided to that."
8394.900,8399.700,en-us,0.75580,,1," And in the first instance, you did say each part you better in it."
8399.700,8400.300,en-us,0.75580,,2," Don't go. Yes."
8402.200,8404.200,en-us,0.95037,,2," Success was clearly divided before Justice."
8406.800,8407.800,en-us,0.58006,,2," Thank you."
8412.000,8414.400,en-us,0.57794,,1," Reply is just about what to say."
8414.400,8414.700,en-us,0.57794,,2," Okay."
8416.200,8427.900,en-us,0.72023,,2," However there my friend made quite a few actually responded but quite a few points. I'd like to start with 101 the amendment here."
8433.100,8438.900,en-us,0.70521,,2," Was relied on her neck in order to drive."
8440.700,8442.000,en-us,0.73478,,2," the principles under which"
8443.600,8447.100,en-us,0.58215,,2," amendment may be struck her up is was"
8447.100,8449.800,en-us,0.58215,,1," he can't this is in your memory?"
8469.900,8470.600,en-us,0.68502,,2," the amendment"
8472.300,8477.700,en-us,0.84518,,1," to refuse the interfuse the amendment. Yes, and you've already told us about the jurisprudence."
8479.500,8486.000,en-us,0.75762,,2," Yes, however, several would not apply just don't do the Supreme Court and"
8486.000,8487.500,en-us,0.75762,,1," whatnot. So why it wouldn't apply"
8487.500,8495.600,en-us,0.75762,,2," developed because it was guidance for summary judgment motions. Not for many emotions."
8495.600,8496.600,en-us,0.75762,,1," Perfect next."
8497.300,8497.600,en-us,0.58143,,2," next"

8506.500,8517.600,en-us,0.66605,,2," That did not allow this treatment, which is not correct. One of those specific claims is against popular debut for threats and"
8517.600,8523.200,en-us,0.66605,,1," try to yes, and then you you're saying"
8531.000,8534.300,en-us,0.43948,,1," Okay."
8548.300,8558.400,en-us,0.73008,,2," Here there's fun. Also missed submissions about them limitations for officers or and you know Honor made a point about the hurdles."
8560.100,8565.900,en-us,0.91491,,2," of having time limitations fortunately, in this case the timers of limitations have not even started"
8565.900,8566.700,en-us,0.91491,,1," we"

8594.400,8602.100,en-us,0.68360,,1," you don't need to reply. I'm just I think we were discussing what you need to face later down the road if we return it."
8611.400,8631.800,en-us,0.73484,,2," And about the basic section exemptions, there's fun and mix the arc the daily that respond makes the argument that some of the exemptions that come under schedule 3 of the exact Tax Act to apply which are the exemptions with respect to time spent outside the 800 dollars per day."
