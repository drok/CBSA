1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,900
order

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:32,000
The special sitting of the federal court of appeal is now open the yarn will met him Justice Gautier The Honorable Mr. Justice Webb and the envelope metam Justice Riverland are presiding the court calls found numbers a101 -10 and a 102 Dash 18 Radu ho Jung and the minister of Public Safety and emergency preparedness. The Helen will be representing himself in Mr. Peterson will be representing the response.

3
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,800
Good morning.

4
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:11,300
First the question. What is the meaning of spending is that?

5
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:23,300
Is a request for the court to consider a decision of a lower court or another Authority in decision-making capacity.

6
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,500
Is that about correct

7
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000
in this particular case yesterday it was?

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:49,700
Now this is a motion. Okay, and I'm emotion from a trial court. We applied the standard of review that means our judge whether we can intervene for not according to a case called thousand.

9
00:01:50,500 --> 00:02:01,200
If it is a question of love, we apply the correctness we see if it's correct. And if it is an exactly know or things like that, which normally is

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:18,400
a question of summary judgment is normally exactly know maybe not in this case. It's it's palpable and overriding are and that's a very I stand we have to become there was no records whatsoever to ground.

11
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,500
the findings

12
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,100
Of course my question

13
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,400
okay with you understand it like I

14
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:47,300
do my question was more General someone more General. It was directed to the word appeal not necessarily in this course. Yeah, because it is referred. For example in the federal court the case before us has to do with the Customs that where there's a word there that says a decision of the minister may be appealed in a federal court.

15
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes, but you have to be careful.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,500
with one understands of the word appeal in a statue

17
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:06,400
does not always mean the same thing the Supreme Court told us that in several statue the word appeal means almost so it's like

18
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,200
It's a difficult. But in this case why is relevant to your cakes because what is before us?

19
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,700
Is the decision of Justice?

20
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes, the decision was just English.

21
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,700
No, don't worry. I mean this is

22
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:51,900
they don't be relaxed the first the first Essence started as an appeal of a decision of the minister of Public Safety under one person's mind section 135 the language in the Customs Act was

23
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:05,600
that the decision is appealed to the medical. So my question is what does the word appeal mean in such a setting does it not mean? I'm requesting the court to have a look at The Minister's decision. Yes.

24
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,700
But I'm not sure that this is really all that relevant to what is important.

25
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,800
It will be.

26
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,300
Okay. So you like to explain that?

27
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,100.0000000000291
Yes, of course second question is

28
00:04:19,100.0000000000291 --> 00:04:24,100
In the context of the Courts of the federal courts, what is an act of Parliament?

29
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,700
My understanding is that it is.

30
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,600
That is just it's not a procedural. It's not a procedural rule.

31
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,900
It is a piece of evidence is evidence of the truth against which the court measures.

32
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,200
Um,

33
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,300
it's a nice apartment

34
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,600
it is that's correct. But what is it to you? Is it evidence? Is it rules? Is it procedural?

35
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,500
It's not

36
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,300
it's not the measuring stick.

37
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,800
Yes.

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,700
so and after Parliament

39
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,600
Set out what the truth is. It's something that you

40
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,700
wrote it has nothing to do with the dog or the dog is the law and the true relates to evidence.

41
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:14,900
All right.

42
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,600
So when you are asked to take an act of parliament under traditional review

43
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Does that not mean that

44
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:41,000
we're not taking an act of parliament under judicial review not under 135 we're looking at the whether or not there is a contraction that's a factual and legal question. If there was a comfortable under the constant. We're not discussing the validity of the custom.

45
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,900
My wording was was was working. What I meant to say is when you take

46
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:56,400
an act of parliament under traditional notice according to the Canada Evidence Act

47
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,800
The court has to take back the parliament as judicial notice.

48
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,100
Does not mean that you

49
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,200
okay, where are they? Just we have two hours. Okay, three hours for your two files.

50
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:20,100
It's nice. If you want to raise all kinds of culinary questions, but you will have to get to the meat that's what we have to decide

51
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,900
very well. I always get this one.

52
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Very important question for me. They originally the first distance.

53
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,300
Wasn't the process and it was quite substantial substantially in terms of evidence provided the appealable.

54
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
for the motion

55
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,400
for Amendment for summer judgment was substantial.

56
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,700
sum 700 pages

57
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,400
my question to you is

58
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,700
give me that my presentation today is aims to succeed at convincing other was a an overriding are and that you have to drink.

59
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,500
What is spent am I required to do?

60
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,600
orginal

61
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Um, in other words,

62
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,800
they just think that says before us are the two Appeals.

63
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Okay, if two of their books.

64
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,100
For me it feels because one has several so that's what before us.

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:36,800
I don't know yet how you want to proceed. So if you worked proceed then I would be helping you by saying you have evidence. We can't talk to them in here.

66
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:44,400
Of course. My question is in case I convinced you that that your intervention is required.

67
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,900
What what this case be returned back to the federal court for the determination. Would you determine the facts? Where would I we

68
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,100
don't determine facts?

69
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,800
So would it go back to the drug court then?

70
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,800
It depends on what they says we intervene.

71
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,800
We can't make fun things.

72
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:15,100
So if all the facts don't need to be determined and it's a pure question at all we can decide.

73
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,800
It's not that if there's a reassessment of the others.

74
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,500
Then we send it back.

75
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:34,500
All right, very good. Perfect that answers to my first trip. My last one is I noticed that the deficiency of my book of authority of authorities for the a101 case, which is the amendment.

76
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,500
I noticed that I entered the wrong.

77
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,400
Section of the Trail Court rules I would like to submit around.

78
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,300
That's the responsibility.

79
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:11,200
The federal court rules I have I had quoted I meant to include rules 76.

80
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,400
And 200 which are relevant to memory.

81
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,300
So don't worry. We don't know we will find it.

82
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,700
All right.

83
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,100
So that your time and patience and over again?

84
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,900
Are they just start with one-to-one, which is the amendment motion. I will be.

85
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,400
Have two words to presenting the the reason.

86
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,400
Why amendments are necessary why the members are done at all?

87
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,400
And how they fit with the rest of the preceding.

88
00:09:50,200 --> 00:10:07,100
What's their purpose and me then? I will describe the overriding and palpable errors that an ocean. Judge May and after this I will close by.

89
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,600
By showing why you should intervene and change the

90
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,000
clock decision now.

91
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,400
How are you? I don't know how much time you need to.

92
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,700
What was the I just want you to have that

93
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:45,000
was much more than that. I have just killed it down to

94
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,900
buy

95
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,300
locked.

96
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,400
So

97
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,200
how much time do you think the two?

98
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,900
Presentation

99
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,800
for both of you. I think I will need the entire time I made and go over time.

100
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,600
I made we won't go over.

101
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,400
There we go.

102
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,000
I may not be able to finish.

103
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,800
in the

104
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,400
in

105
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:14,600
the cell phone what I would suggest to you. Okay, and you decide what you want to do, but I was suggest to you that as a court of appeal. We know very well.

106
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,100
What is the meaning of an amendment and the rules has to do it?

107
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,900
If I were you, I would really dig immediately into why there's an error.

108
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,200
seriously

109
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,500
You can't trust us. We know the rules about them. Okay?

110
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,500
That's where you'll have more time. Yes.

111
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:46,300
However, I would like to very very briefly talk about the meaning honorable to you know.

112
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,400
ordinary action the purpose of the amendments to the cleanings are to set the

113
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:18,700
agenda for for the procedure that is to inform both the defendant and of course as to what the issues and questions are such that there are no surprise is to either party and such that their the defendants rights are protected such that they can prepare for for the eventual trial.

114
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:31,300
Um, according to the federal court rules amendments can be made at very stages of the proceeding with or without legal of the Court.

115
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
As before the dependent given submits a reply.

116
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Amendment can be made without without even

117
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,200
being that in this case. The statement of Defense had been

118
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,600
Yes,

119
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,800
so that's a that's a reply. So that means you need the leaf of the Court,

120
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,700
correct?

121
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,100
Okay, so let's get on with

122
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,100
My point is that even after that the defense is is entered.

123
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,200
Their the parties can still consent.

124
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,000
No, I mean.

125
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,100
was considered

126
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,200
If there is a consent, but it's still the court that this up

127
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,400
everything.

128
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,800
I will then skip to the powerful Bears. So on the emotional format the motion judge.

129
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,800
the most

130
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,100
visible problem of errors that take considered evidence and deciding the motion which is something that

131
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,500
he is not permitted to consider oriented with the federal court rules. And also according to the Ontario civil procedure.

132
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,600
Okay, why don't you turn to the rules which rules says that he doesn't have the right to look at that and

133
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,500
the automation

134
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,400
High

135
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's have a look.

136
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:37,200
That's which case

137
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,700
Fisher.

138
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
23

139
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,900
I don't have pages and that's what I'm

140
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
gonna be at the bottom of the page bottom line.

141
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Yes, but age 23 for me is a tax axis.

142
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,600
the excise tax act

143
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,300
the latest Authority book

144
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,500
Yeah.

145
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,600
Yeah.

146
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,600
My friend as a book.

147
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,900
And the same book with different pages.

148
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,500
Okay Bauer.

149
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,100
as my colleague said

150
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,300
So you have the same one. You don't have the Devourer?

151
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay. Okay. I don't know why

152
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm saying one may see it.

153
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,500
Yes.

154
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,700
This is one of two

155
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,300
your friend to 102

156
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,400
know. This is the book for one or two.

157
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,300
But you said you were dealing with 101.

158
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm dealing with one-on-one, but somehow the printing.

159
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,700
They must have fallen the the front pages.

160
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:37,800
The covers.

161
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,700
Okay.

162
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,200
No problem.

163
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,300
You're referring to the decision.

164
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,600
Which paragraph

165
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,500
paragraph 16?

166
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,300
Stinky. Yes.

167
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:08,300
When determining whether amendment should be allowed to the church setting the matter Joshua capable of getting

168
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,800
instructions

169
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:15,700
for being struck in the middle court rules.

170
00:17:16,599.9999999998836 --> 00:17:18,200
Are is rule number?

171
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,300
in 2121

172
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,000
But there are several paragraphs.

173
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:33,400
And only the paragraph no reasonable cause of action. You don't look at evidence all the other paragraph you look at it.

174
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:41,700
Yes

175
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,700
generous, correct.

176
00:17:45,700 --> 00:18:02,800
So if the church things that there's no chance of success or taxation or and that's the another paragraph that you want one where is entitled to look at it?

177
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:18,200
Yes. However in those in this case those were not considered for those other points the church didn't look what was immaterial or redundant material. He didn't look at whether there was candles. He was no language like that in his decision.

178
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,400
Oh, okay. Let's look at the decision.

179
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:38,300
is order

180
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,200
Yes, power

181
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
power antenna.

182
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes, so that's the same case you refer to

183
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
yes.

184
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,700
And the proposed extending that came to not demonstrate their reasonable chance of success.

185
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
I guess you're under the test for

186
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,600
for emotions to amend is

187
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:08,900
I was

188
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I think most authoritatively rested by the federal court by the Supreme Court and Imperial tobacco.

189
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,100
Yes,

190
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,600
which is records by these other cases.

191
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,400
Yes.

192
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800
very little case is that

193
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,200
page

194
00:19:50,700 --> 00:20:03,600
So yeah, but that was also that 22 a 2.18 it was the there was no reasonable cause of action so there he don't look at evidence.

195
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
well, perhaps it would then be

196
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:23,300
helpful for me to look at why MMS are necessary what their life cycle is why why and when evidence should not considered in a case that emotion to amend would be

197
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:33,600
Dismissed that is the client will be blocked from being heard. The plaintiff can always submit.

198
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,200
That many men as a new option.

199
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:52,100
As a new statement of Clans to pursue the same dispute because just by blocking the amendment does not result. It is just so the plaintiff would then

200
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,600
get it as a new action.

201
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,500
based on the same material thoughts

202
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,300
It's always because

203
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,900
you say if he doesn't allow the amendments.

204
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,300
Their claim as it was is still before the court. Is that what you

205
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,800
said is, correct?

206
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Okay. So the same before the court is still and that brings us to the second appeal.

207
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,700
Because you see these things are very much linked.

208
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:26,700
Yeah.

209
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,900
But the Amendments the proposed amendments are are left in the air. They're not

210
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,100
having discarded.

211
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:59,200
Allow them you're saying that they still exist in that there's still a cause of action.

212
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,700
That's available to you.

213
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,400
There's something adding to something that goes over there.

214
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,700
Well, you are one of the Amendments doesn't produce any costs about

215
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,500
which one

216
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,800
that is the one that

217
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
All right proposed on them.

218
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,200
You're adding two defendants.

219
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,400
I might put a defenders in their capacity as a crowned as agents of the crown.

220
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:49,200
Okay, 25 just by I'm looking now at the age of 48 Bill booking.

221
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,500
That is Amanda the underlying

222
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,100
yes,

223
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,600
which one has the new Car Connection?

224
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,900
The claim is that the CBS history commits under 16th South America RC. The CBC is circulates the internal operations. Thank you.

225
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,100
and

226
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,000
61

227
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,200
so that's

228
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,000
60 16 C is on page 60

229
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
page. Yes, 16 C is on page 161

230
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
I have a home page

231
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,900
660.

232
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,400
Is that the cbsa?

233
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,000
For me, it's page 60.

234
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,100
So I don't know why but okay. So that's the important thing. We have the right pair. So you're saying this is a new cause an action

235
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,900
it alleges that they

236
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,000
say is involved in Monday.

237
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,200
but that's not it's just

238
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:35,700
Isn't it just a remedy? Because you've already said that you thought that you was

239
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,200
enabling

240
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:53,900
I just had not mentioned money laundering if you are my longer is a new cause of action in the Amendments before that in the original statement of

241
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,800
Planting my head suspected that it was something that's

242
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,100
good. So what else is a new cause

243
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,600
and there's a lot

244
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,300
of underlining.

245
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,100
Yes, but most of this is really.

246
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:23,500
All related you see you cannot come to 16 and plain unless you've had allegation in the first part.

247
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,600
So there are allegations that are linked to these.

248
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Because you see like that these this is not a new cause of action. It's just

249
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:46,600
you're making education of fat that would bring you into whatever remedy you're asking.

250
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,200
Well, if I find religion that CBS is a criminal organization.

251
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:01,700
Okay, let's not lose too much time on this. Okay. So here saying let's say 17 a is a new plane because it's finished.

252
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,500
There before that was there before.

253
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:24,600
So that this new apart from that because you didn't ask for 2004 we did ask for 15,000.

254
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,900
I'm just not seeing.

255
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,300
New cause of action that would stand on their own.

256
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,800
the honor this

257
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,400
without finding specifically the paragraph because they're so many that I had touched the allegation of

258
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,400
money laundering and criminal organization are new.

259
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,700
Okay, and what what's the point of this do you were saying that these would stand on their own in another proceedings?

260
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,900
They can be pursued on their own. So

261
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,200
now there's not Time bar.

262
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:12,500
You have the time limitation issue. You cannot take an action, you know 20 years from the date of the events and say I have this

263
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,900
is correct. But at the time that they maybe was proposed.

264
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,600
I had only just learned about the money laundering.

265
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Okay, you can always what you're saying is that you can

266
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,400
take a separate action. Is that what you're

267
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
saying? Well, yes.

268
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,900
Okay. So why don't you that's what you say

269
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,800
because that would not be the most vicious and and this cost way to reach Justice.

270
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,700
Okay, that's your argument for why you made an error?

271
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,900
Because we have to make sense of this.

272
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,300
Well, you are my argument is that he used evidence where shouldn't have?

273
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,900
the court

274
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,400
I'm sorry. My presentation is

275
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,700
no I'm just trying to make sure that I don't want to miss what you're saying.

276
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,400
You started with that. Okay that you should not have look at that. I thought

277
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,800
well, you said that he may not look at evidence on

278
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:31,400
2.181 a but it can't accept there's a they are exception under eight for to addiction. For example.

279
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Well, they're not stated in their rules. You're on.

280
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Yeah, but they're stated in the case of

281
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,500
that's very cute in their role. It doesn't say and the thing that the rule is being construed by Caseville.

282
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,200
and

283
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,200
if I'm not mistaken, it's fun for

284
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
That but anyway, I

285
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,300
am

286
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,900
operating we continue

287
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,100
operating under the guidance of the Supreme Court.

288
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,100
Says very clearly and without doubt.

289
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,500
All

290
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,900
okay. Let's let's

291
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,200
continue

292
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:46,300
and 23

293
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:05,500
What is impossible to enumerate all the factors that a judge must take into participation determining whether an adjustment?

294
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:21,400
Where is it whether it is just a given case to authorizing Amendment. The general rules is that an amendment should be allowed at any state or the action for the purpose of determining their real questions and controversy between the department provided notably that the allowance will not result in an injustice.

295
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,800
For the other party and not capable of being Complicated by an award of costs.

296
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,500
That's good. That's good. As I told you don't lose too much time on the law. We can read it

297
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:38,500
in case you're under that is oh I have for

298
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,600
this presentation

299
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,900
that's that's

300
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,500
wrong in using evidence

301
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,700
and that would be an airplane.

302
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,900
specifically

303
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:08,000
Or it might be an error in his that is a reasons are not clear enough as to which paragraph he was looking at.

304
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:21,400
Well the owner in a few words I can demonstrate why looking at sectional 106 which is what the defendant proposed is flawed to look at that point. And that's for

305
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,000
the amendment.

306
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,600
No, one of the Customs out.

307
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,900
Yes, but we're now looking at are you

308
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:36,500
on the amendment? I'm only doing with the members so far. I'm understanding that. We're addressing these two cases separately.

309
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,900
No, but what your hour and a half is for the two of them?

310
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,700
It's three hours for both.

311
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,600
Yes. We are only dealing with

312
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,000
so what

313
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,200
do you want to say about so

314
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:59,700
many six the pendant proposed officers wear?

315
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,600
Would not be liable.

316
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,600
For their actions under the custom job.

317
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,100
Yes.

318
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:15,200
Nobody do not be liable. Not under the customer's of

319
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,000
Activities.

320
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,700
Yes

321
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,000
under the Customs act and yes, they are nothing for someone

322
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,100
okay, if they are not in pursuant.

323
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,500
The crown cannot be the scariest sleep liable.

324
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:35,000
You cannot sue the crown for something done outside of their duties. You can sue them but you cannot sue the crown.

325
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,700
Well the crown

326
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:42,200
either they are inside their Duty and the crown because of the employer are liable for them.

327
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,600
Okay, they cherish me or they're not doing it on their Duty then they are responsible for it.

328
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,600
Well, they're not doing it in their personal capacity.

329
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:11,100
What if they're doing a frog that's what you're saying? They're doing a fraud. It's and it's outside of the customer. You're trying to get out of Windows 6 to get out of Windows 6. You have to get out of the crust on that and you have to get out of the vicarious liability of the front.

330
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,800
You know, the word is

331
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,300
not really

332
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:24,200
cares means you are responsible for your agents and employees for what he did in the performance of their Duty.

333
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:25,900
See what

334
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,100
and

335
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,400
so you could sue them personally.

336
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,400
And that may not come under one was six if it is outside of their Duty.

337
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:45,000
But that's not be within the jurisdiction of our core because we only can entertain that kind of action against the crown itself,

338
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,500
correct?

339
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,900
The other person assuming that the thought is true.

340
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,700
Assuming that the fact is traded

341
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,100
are true.

342
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,700
Fraud would have to be one of the tools that these officers are allowed to employ to implement the custom job.

343
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,600
They have a number of activities that they can employers actually searches questioning.

344
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,199.99999999976717
I'm sorry, you're saying that they are entitled to use fraud as a mean of performing their Duty

345
00:34:11,199.99999999976717 --> 00:34:12,600
I'm saying they are not.

346
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,900
Okay, and

347
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,000
that's why the protection 106 does not protect them from yes,

348
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,600
and how do you

349
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:26,000
Why do you think that the crown can be liable for something that is not within their Duty?

350
00:34:32,800.0000000002328 --> 00:34:34,600
And their Duty under the customers that

351
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,000
you know, putting their duty of anything to abroad.

352
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,800.0000000002328
they were doing the Frog as a

353
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,199.99999999976717
Um, they were justifying it as implementing the Customs app.

354
00:34:49,800.0000000002328 --> 00:34:51,800.0000000002328
So their cover was that their

355
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,600
their Duty

356
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:05,100
If we had met on the street and they asked me for for my coins, I would not have given this to them as a personal as a person.

357
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,000
as an individual I only gave him my coins because they were

358
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,100
young in case you know that you

359
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,200
for one was it?

360
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,200
And that they could not apply to the front.

361
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,300
the one Florida I can point to

362
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,900
is about to

363
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,700
yes,

364
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,600
which is

365
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,400
already for one of two and I referring to

366
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,400
versus Canada pitch 46

367
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,200
Network and no check

368
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,100
their

369
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,300
second

370
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,300
the case that I have

371
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,900
is all about

372
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,300
No at 46 mm.

373
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,000
the courgette

374
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,500
second loss on the four days

375
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,100
just a second.

376
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,600
I don't have a 46 in the other one so attached.

377
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,600
Yes, it is one of the longer table.

378
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,300
Yes and my page 46.

379
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,900
Oh, is it because you didn't?

380
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,300
Did you just put Pages without the front and just a page out of the text?

381
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:12,600
Yes.

382
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:17,900
the

383
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,000
point about that case though just to bring us back to the

384
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:32,700
point is that under paragraph 30 if if illegal acts are really done from the motive other than a modest drive to execute a statutory or legal Duty.

385
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:42,400
Then the public of that towards the end. The public authorities Act is not Advanced for the acts complaint.

386
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Of are not done in the headache execution of a statute, but only in the pretended execution Darrow.

387
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:52,700
that's

388
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
not

389
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,500
the one of the tools that they can employ they were however using

390
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:16,400
pretending to access customers officers pretending that these coins where goes so that they could see them and request their

391
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:24,700
understanding for something that's outside of their Duty.

392
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,700
Uh, and that's the crown is the act.

393
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,300
Do you have

394
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,200
they were on

395
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,200
just a second have you put Council the prom night identity and section?

396
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,600
I have

397
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,500
the

398
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,200
color liability.

399
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,700
is 101

400
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,300
11

401
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,500
at age 12

402
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:12,800
for the damage for which it could wear a person it would be liable.

403
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,800
Yes, and

404
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,300
any other problems in respect of a torque committed by a servant of the crown?

405
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,300
the full

406
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,500
I don't know if the

407
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,200
things you brought

408
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,700
the same thing

409
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,500
outside of their duties totally

410
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,900
Responsible so we have to look at this

411
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,700
but they

412
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,900
just saying don't have it before you before us we'll have to look at

413
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,800
all right?

414
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,600
Good. So what will do is to make sure that you have?

415
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,200
I don't want to construe 31.

416
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Okay, 3 a little eye without you being able to make submissions on it.

417
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,600
So I would

418
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:28,700
give you.

419
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,000
Or Thursday with the end of the Linux Monday.

420
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:45,200
Be a good you can write to the court and say here are some Authority that I would like to submit to show that a fraud would come with them.

421
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,600
three

422
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:55,700
I'm not able to I am out of the my home country for a week.

423
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,800
I live in Mexico I have for much of the time I came here specialty.

424
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,100
Um, can I have two weeks?

425
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,200
Until the following.

426
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:14,000
Yes it just that we won't be so long as the case is not closed. We cannot render a decision if I give you two weeks.

427
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,600
I'm just saying I don't know when you'll get your decision because we sit everywhere.

428
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,600
and the time to write your case by the next week, so

429
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,500
well, in any case I have I have no way of getting of sitting down and looking at this until

430
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,700
at the very least Wednesday

431
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,500
the earliest Wednesday

432
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,300
Okay, so, okay. You'll have to wait.

433
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,200
that means

434
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,800
And you understand what we're looking for.

435
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,500
Um, my understanding is that you are looking for representations as to why the crowd of the

436
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,400
Sure, and I can meet their pointed out. We're looking at three B.

437
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,200
little I

438
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,600
because it's not the province of today.

439
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,500
Another problem.

440
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,000
Yes.

441
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,200
Okay, so three

442
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,800
so why should be like in

443
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,600
the case of would apply to make the crown viable for fraud?

444
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
for frog permitted outside of their

445
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,700
Are we making this assumption that if they were working on the clock and working on?

446
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
working on this feature

447
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,100
that they are outside of their doing.

448
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:12,900
They are trying to

449
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,600
that's what you are supposed to I'm giving you a chance to argue this point.

450
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,400
Okay.

451
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,000
Thank you.

452
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,800
Wow, that is all I have for 8411.

453
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,500
for just additions I would like to move on to

454
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,000
and obviously

455
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
the other side will have the right to respond

456
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
respond. Yes,

457
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:39,700
there are.

458
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,400
numerous probable errors

459
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,000
to discuss the first one

460
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,200
the judge was required to find whether

461
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,200
section 1.02

462
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,700
let me these backtrack and he's saying

463
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,900
and explain the larger picture

464
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,900
in the 102 and the

465
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,900
motion for

466
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
summary judgment

467
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,300
the defendant made for presentation

468
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,500
to guide the way the case was considered he

469
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:23,900
completed

470
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,300
and appeal under Section

471
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,500
132 135

472
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,300
135 with the purpose of the entire action.

473
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:36,700
He

474
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,100
represented that

475
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,100
Wherever section 1325 claim appears.

476
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:59,500
The preceding is a special type of proceeding that is outside of those defined under the federal court rules. He said he said that it is not neither an application for you neither.

477
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,800
An ordinary action, neither a simplified action neither a class action.

478
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:14,500
He alleges that an appeal is just a different type of proceeding where the cord is being asked to.

479
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,200
reconsider

480
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,300
a new the decision that was before Minister. He represents that.

481
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,000
The job of the task before the judge was to decide.

482
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,200
in The Minister's place

483
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,200
based on new evidence

484
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,100
was it was a contradiction or not?

485
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,300
Guiding the preceding this way can only lead to.

486
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,200
an outcome in his favor

487
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,700
and it is incorrect the an appeal.

488
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:04,600
Under 16001 305 is simply one plane.

489
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,200
that can be entered as part of the

490
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,100
ordinary National

491
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,200
the preceding type

492
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:19,600
that you're allowed to make a 135 claim under is an ordinary action.

493
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,300
and the

494
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,600
appeal is only one of

495
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,200
the claims available

496
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,200
However, there is nothing in the Customs act that preclude a plated from.

497
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:46,000
From joining other other claims that arise from the same class from the same details.

498
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,500
Do you agree because the judge on two cases start?

499
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,700
a decision

500
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,200
Are we in Korean?

501
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,700
Yes,

502
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,300
and now

503
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,000
these two cases deal with

504
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,100
And that an action or a negation?

505
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,400
Consisting the amount of tenant.

506
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,900
You can test the amount of penalty interaction.

507
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:42,400
No,

508
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:49,500
okay. So do you agree that if we follow these cases because in that custom app?

509
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,600
clear that to

510
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,400
challenge a decision on the penalty

511
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,900
you have to go to a judicial.

512
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:58,800
I do not.

513
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,900
Penalties.

514
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,100
Yes, I do not.

515
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So you can't test that.

516
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,400
Yes.

517
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,700
Okay, even though you're not doing it.

518
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,000
Correct.

519
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:08,900
So

520
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:10,900
you

521
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:30,700
have

522
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,000
everything

523
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,100
I believe

524
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,900
star we was.

525
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,500
In Star way, there were two issues.

526
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:26,100
There was both with it whether they issue that there was a an infection and all so the issue of whether the minister could keep that line.

527
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,000
He the dark specifically looked.

528
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,400
And explained that it makes no sense to allow the defendant to keep.

529
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,200
The terms of release if the decision was cannot stand.

530
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,300
I'm sorry. Yeah.

531
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,400
amount of the penalty one must apply for two children

532
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:00,000
Before it has been determined that the case committed. This is an nominee. Okay.

533
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,000
and everybody has said it's an enemy but

534
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Well, it may be an anomaly. I am referring to starway at my authority page 44 and 45.

535
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,100
They're just 27 and 28.

536
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,700
Okay

537
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,900
start with

538
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,600
20 seconds

539
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,900
44

540
00:51:44,200 --> 00:52:00,500
That's that's an ordinary National. The only special rolling pose. Was that whether Mr. Start with it or not? Just kidding first of all.

541
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:08,000
I will deal with this a little later. The amount of penalty is not an issue. This is a child mother paper review.

542
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,900
Yes, and where does he say that you can dispute the penalty?

543
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,700
In an action

544
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:28,500
the next paragraph paragraph 28 begins with the next issue the position of the penalty not the amount of the road.

545
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
The defendant submit that at best I can only declare and so on and so on.

546
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:45,800
At the end of the paragraph the paragraph 28 Star Wars says since there was no infraction of the Customs act it follows that defendants cannot keep the amount forfeit.

547
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Yeah, but that's a different question. I was talking to you about the amount of dependents.

548
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,900
I know that in your action, you do discuss that the amount was reduced by the minister.

549
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,200
three

550
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:14,200
once there is no contraction. What can you do? Obviously, there's no contributions. There's no control

551
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:25,100
your others that the defendant states that the only available remedy for you for the court is to declare what it was will not contribute.

552
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,500
He specifically says

553
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:36,600
I didn't know nothing else, but you were going with okay. So you're trying to say under 135. What are the remnants?

554
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,300
But what we're looking at now is whether you can.

555
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,800
Be very cute and application.

556
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,200
Or an ordinary action to contest the amount of dependent.

557
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,000
Well, they are

558
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,100
but there's an issue

559
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,400
it is a client.

560
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,300
I would like to point out ACL.

561
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:10,500
I'm not I have to say I'm not 100% I just want to make sure we get your point on this.

562
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,700
I would like to point out to ACL as another example where

563
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,300
bringing it back to your

564
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,000
part

565
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,200
I'm saying that.

566
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,000
just because

567
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,800
a claim under Section 135 discontinued within an ordinary option. Yes.

568
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:43,500
There is no provision in the Customs act to make it the exclusive claim that can be made in that ordinary action,

569
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:43,900
right?

570
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:51,500
There's no the customers that itself does not limit does not say that you may not have another claim that is related to

571
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,600
the same time. And what's not clear is

572
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:00,000
if it is clear in customary.

573
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,800
certain issues need to be dealt with by judicial review

574
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,800
certain decision

575
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:22,300
That's that's the problem. I'm trying to eliminate. Is there anything in your plane?

576
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:31,700
That would be comparable to the planes that were made in the two cases on which their Church relies.

577
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:42,900
Which is just staring. Yes, there are multiple multiple claims multiple clamps in the same options.

578
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,300
Is there any of those planes in your action?

579
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,500
That are the same as the planes that were dealt with in Star Wars and

580
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,400
New Year. Well, they're not the same claims.

581
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Not same

582
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
at the same time.

583
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,400
I think that's the point that you you want to make.

584
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:10,200
It's not what is dealt with in those cases was something that needed to be done by application.

585
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,000
not by actions

586
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:27,400
we were to discuss the if I could if I were to address this issue of application versus action the Customs does not even require the amount of people just good by way of about the issue.

587
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,100
Yes, but that's

588
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,200
that's what it's supposed to be.

589
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
This decision have to be about federal office.

590
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:53,400
But all this must be done, you know, there can be a conversion if you want wet damages from that decision.

591
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,100
And this is why I was pointing to ACL kind of so,

592
00:56:59,100 --> 00:56:59,700
yeah.

593
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
fish 42

594
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:22,100
here in ACL the judge looked at section 135 claim and concluded at airglass 61.

595
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,000
Yes

596
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
third line from the bottom that

597
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:33,400
under the section 135 the flame the Vintage action and this regard must be dismissed.

598
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,900
within that regard

599
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,200
which Regard

600
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,300
in regard to section 135

601
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,400
Okay, so

602
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,500
why is that of interest to us? It seems to confirm with the judge was saying

603
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,600
it's just so under 35 135.

604
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:28,200
That specific claim can be dismissed. However, he went on to consider the claim under 1:33 and following paragraph paragraph 60.

605
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,300
Actually the second following paragraph

606
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:39,700
93 and also clean and declaration and it is in tactical to retainment and return of the forfeit himself.

607
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,700
and

608
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,500
63

609
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,100
and it's a leader as a matter.

610
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,700
Of 35 does not give them.

611
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:20,200
That's right. And he says either 135 or otherwise under the act or the general jurisdiction of the Court.

612
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,700
which which means that if if

613
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:32,800
A relief thought was within the general jerk editions of the course. He would he would have to consider it.

614
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,900
He did not consider the that relief only because he was concerning section one.

615
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:42,900
33

616
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,700
but you were relying on a passage.

617
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:58,600
Where you said the judge confirmed that the court could give could make an order or for that. There's no money for people that was the previous case that you called.

618
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:07,300
And now they're saying we don't have that jurisdiction. So these two cases will have to go and look at okay.

619
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:19,300
if another if another remedy within the

620
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:27,100
Action was within the general jurisdiction of the tradition of the Court. He would have to consider it.

621
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:36,700
Yes. He says it's not within the jurisdiction for 50 that's come directly to what you just said before

622
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,800
that's specific claim you are right,

623
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,400
you know, what will be there because

624
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,100
I found

625
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:49,100
that we should be distinguishing to start.

626
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:59,900
You know, no I'm not let me just finish my thought your I think saying that the judge was wrong and in.

627
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,000
Losing those two cases through a lot of fun.

628
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,100
Because of your case is differently, it can be distinguished and you're relying on ACL.

629
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,200
to say that the court has

630
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,600
more jurisdiction to deal with these matters. Is that is that what it is

631
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,700
it is however in in

632
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:27,600
yes, so we based on ACL the port does have more services addition to consider.

633
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,200
your clients

634
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,700
Visitors section one is 33 which is additional clients.

635
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,000
Okay,

636
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,600
so I want to make sure I understand your points. Okay?

637
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:51,900
There's one which is a page 45. It would continue on reading his family after we talked about he pointed out these he says the money he can't keep the money that there's no one fraction.

638
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:53,400
Then

639
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,400
kind of playing on his self-portrait. There's allocation should be returned.

640
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,000
Now, so was it just over your comments in

641
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,200
the judge?

642
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:06,000
Or do you have to order the money thing? Because they have to have the judgment.

643
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:17,700
That will go on and even though they may not have jurisdiction to deal with something just point out the Trap as long as my decision. You really should do something even though it may not be able to order you to do something.

644
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,100
I don't know if there was an order or

645
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:29,200
it was just not well the seems to be logical thing you really

646
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:29,700
should do.

647
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,800
So we'll look at that. What?

648
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:48,300
I would like post a point out and paragraph 63 of ACL.

649
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,600
the judge did

650
01:02:53,900 --> 01:03:04,100
towards the end hate hands with I conclude that in order should go setting aside the minister determination made under section one, but his face and referring both Myers back for

651
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:04,900
restoration

652
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,400
by another judicator.

653
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,300
So that means that even in an action in an ordinary action.

654
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,200
Section 133 was good,

655
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:23,900
you know what would read the case because that's why normally you shouldn't have a page like this. We don't have to have the whole case here have it all.

656
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,300
Before but we'll look at so that's your third.

657
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,800
What else do you want to say about 102?

658
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,500
about jointer

659
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,500
It's again.

660
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,200
It's

661
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,100
six of your rules

662
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,200
Well, there's no claim of underwater systems.

663
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,500
I'm talking about the rules. You're not talking.

664
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,400
Yes, that will want to want.

665
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,400
to

666
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,700
subject to

667
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:28,400
rules to a party to my request really good against another party as interesting in respect of more than one client.

668
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,000
Yes.

669
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:38,600
So it would be incorrect. So it was a palpable number right here for for the motion injection.

670
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:46,700
To disallow this Rule and claimed that only a section 135 claim can be made in an ordinary action.

671
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,400
when the rules of thrill Court obviously say otherwise

672
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:59,500
anything else

673
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:07,500
Yes.

674
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:11,400
You're going very well.

675
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,600
You're right.

676
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,600
Yeah, that's why that's

677
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,300
just to a party may occur the court May order separate clamps.

678
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,300
Or many orders that came to be split or to be dealt with in a more convenient fashion.

679
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,200
So with your saying is they should have split it.

680
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,800
If you thought that this was completed as a dismissal,

681
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,400
that's right.

682
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:53,900
Okay.

683
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:05,200
Because just ignoring and and the spacing claims without looking at them. There's no justice in that.

684
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,000
it's not an interest or just

685
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,400
okay.

686
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,400
I'd like to point out.

687
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,700
the X-ray stats are

688
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,700
but this goes again to multiple.

689
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,300
Preceding

690
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:27,500
proceedings to multiple claims in the same proceeding.

691
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:27,900
Yeah

692
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,800
such.

693
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:30,900
as

694
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:42,300
I don't have my I wouldn't need a few seconds to find the section that I'm talking about

695
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,100
the thing that just happened.

696
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,000
It's in your book of a turkey.

697
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,500
25 that I think 25 is the definition of money.

698
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,900
the first year around 15

699
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,900
I may have messed up or if you 1.28.

700
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,500
and 18

701
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,600
21 was in

702
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:49,500
my house

703
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:18,899.9999999995343
actually what I'm trying to make this knot is not doesn't seem to be

704
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,300
I am a little.

705
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:34,000
You know what we could do. Okay, because you're almost at the end of your time. Okay, but what would you will break for five minutes?

706
01:08:35,100.00000000046566 --> 01:08:36,200
The electric thoughts no

707
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:36,899.9999999995343
reason to

708
01:08:36,899.9999999995343 --> 01:08:39,200
update and you pick the things that you are.

709
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:40,700
Yeah,

710
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,800
thank you.

711
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,000
order

712
01:09:06,100.00000000046566 --> 01:09:07,000
resume

713
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:09,399.99999999953434
Thank you.

714
01:09:24,600.0000000004657 --> 01:09:34,300
Give us an example of how if the parliament intended to limit.

715
01:09:35,600.0000000004657 --> 01:09:39,500
The claims available in an ordinary action and they can with specific language.

716
01:09:40,600.0000000004657 --> 01:09:52,600.0000000004657
And the exact side the state they State they specifically exclude their Rules by saying the rules concerning join their parties and causes of action do not apply except the prevent the jointer of appeals under that part.

717
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,000
Which means?

718
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:03,300
Which means that under the Customs activities no such limitation is given it cannot be implied. The chronometer does have the

719
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,600
ability to do it

720
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:22,900
I like to move on to the next point the next clear are the most engaging ignored the plaintiff evidence. The first one would have been currently the Currency Act section 11.

721
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:24,400
Which is that?

722
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,700
Which is authorities book page.

723
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,400
That's where you want to do it the statute.

724
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,900
It's not currency.

725
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,300
It is evidence my understanding of both the answers that.

726
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,800
The acts that I bring that I present to the court with my case,

727
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,200
yes

728
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,700
are part of my evidence but

729
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:09,900
statutes are another their statutes. So don't worry. It means that it might be an error to steal an error.

730
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,000
not consider

731
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,200
relevant section

732
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,200
so you're saying why is it relevant and

733
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,400
it is relevant because specifically

734
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:51,100
By the minister milk break down or otherwise otherwise known as currency any coin that is currently that are encounter.

735
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,500
I like gone online to use otherwise, then it's currently.

736
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,500
Relevant because the current status itself tells us that girls cannot be treated as Goods.

737
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:15,100
If you're not being used as good as good as Goods or something else, it can only be used. It's only a token of current.

738
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:17,900
is specifically

739
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,300
so you're saying

740
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,900
you should go to your argument.

741
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,300
According to your head in this case for the US coin. Yes.

742
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:30,400
I think

743
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,400
they could have an account.

744
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,500
They're not a good time in Canada.

745
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,700
How does 111 apply?

746
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:50,800
there's a pale apparel was drawn and it was on contested by other party that Quentin of the United States the treatment of the United States and in Canada are parallel and equivalent legislation and the rules that would apply to coins in to

747
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,700
corresponding coins in Canada

748
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,700
also applying to currency of the United States

749
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:17,800
What can I have a similar points as the ones I had which are $50 gold coins and five dollar one dollar coins?

750
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:30,600
So the point is that if the Canadian coins cannot can be not not treated cannot be treated as good or as something other than currency. Then the US coins cannot find it.

751
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,200
It's not faces you say that.

752
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:45,600
You honor the the United States public law. That is the that is the corresponding loss of the Canadian one to the Persia States. This has the same

753
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,700
but in the world USAC only applies in the US.

754
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,300
And the Canadian act applies in Canada?

755
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:55,100
so I'm not understanding why the fact that

756
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:02,100
If you ask coins are not currency in Canada a legal tender

757
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:07,600
currency, they are currency in the United States.

758
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,300
Yes.

759
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,600
If there were Native coins.

760
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:18,200
They could also not be considered Goods for the reasons of section one section 11.

761
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:27,200
No question of my colleague was why would this act?

762
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
apply to you whisper

763
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,500
because it shows that kinetic coins are treated.

764
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,400
in a specific way

765
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:38,600
Yes,

766
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,000
and it was never anything contention any

767
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,700
energy because this section cannot apply Direct.

768
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,500
The under the defense agreed that coins of the

769
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,400
we don't care that the breeze or not.

770
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,100
If it's a matter of know we need to know what your positions

771
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:59,600
well in that case. I would have to present the current section from the United States.

772
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
They're not.

773
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,700
Okay. So what is saying is paragraph?

774
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,100
section 11

775
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,100
with apply if they were coins in Canadian bird seed

776
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:24,700
you say my answer by analogy.

777
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:32,200
We should treat the US the same way because the US act as absolutely no application here,

778
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,300
correct.

779
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,600
Okay, so it's by another.

780
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:50,500
Next one. I like to point out that.

781
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:59,700
the motion judge error significant are in accepting the defendant explanation not

782
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,200
the Customs act applies to all Goods

783
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,600
which is not true, they

784
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:31,800
The Customs Act is activated specifically by the excise tax act. It doesn't just come into Force out of the blue for everything that you bring into Canada. For instance. If you import food or water or even my own vehicle that I was driving that day. I was not required to report it to declare it as important in Canada, even though I did in Portland in Canada.

785
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:33,400
and

786
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:42,700
I was not required to declare it. I did not declare it. It's not a problem. The question is why is this because it is a good it is quite valuable.

787
01:16:43,700 --> 01:17:01,200
And so on so we would the tests that he applied to the coins. The reason Goods in general are not immediately subjects. The Customs are is because the Customs the Customs act power is given by the exercise section 51

788
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
which which tells us that that authorities page 15.

789
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:24,400
about 15

790
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:24,800
or 16

791
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,600
we're described where

792
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,300
maybe we can be more precise where

793
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:36,200
of course session 15.8.

794
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:42,200
50 sorry 50.1 50.1

795
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:43,900
point B

796
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,900
And then 51.

797
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,200
so one

798
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:56,300
So

799
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,000
just a second one. I would just read it.

800
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:23,500
Says that this section gives us what the purpose of the Customs Act is and is what octaves the Customs to act on things that are important.

801
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,400
So it's only on

802
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:35,900
Goods that are

803
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:45,500
I'm not sure that I understand what you're saying because 50 says that there shall be imposed a consumption tax.

804
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:53,300
Was imported in Canada payable in accordance with the provision of the custom Act.

805
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,000
Yes.

806
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:56,700
So this

807
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:01,100
it doesn't say that you don't have to be clear something under the customer.

808
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:08,000
It says that the Customs are just unnecessary in the case.

809
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,000
No, no, it does not your part. This section does not.

810
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,300
Okay. So which section because you're

811
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,200
sexually 51.

812
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:30,100
Shows the acceptance 5146 not apply on the sale orientation of good mention is schedule 3.

813
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,400
Yes. So the fact that there's no hats.

814
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,200
Why does it mean that you don't have

815
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:40,700
because there is no taxi to be collected in accordance with the Customs that.

816
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,400
Will have to look at the provision of the first analysis.

817
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,500
I don't think it leaves you.

818
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,200
determine whether

819
01:19:54,500 --> 01:20:01,400
is the if you recall that the provision of the customer if it says in the Care on the goods on which taxes faithful.

820
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,900
The Customs act does not do that. It does not activate itself.

821
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,900
It doesn't nobody doesn't say that you have to be clear.

822
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:13,100
It does not.

823
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,700
That is not the Customs Act.

824
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:24,400
Drop to do the Customs Act only comes into effect in case there is Stacks to be collected.

825
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,700
And in case there is to be collected.

826
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:38,100
It is to be collected in accordance with the customers. That means you have to declare it and you have to pay the tax. Okay, but that's a business decision. That's fine.

827
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:38,500
Okay.

828
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:56,300
Bitch 20, which is one of the exemptions.

829
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,300
and on page 20 part 5

830
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:13,400
contribute part 11 for an upper line part 11 of schedule 3. It's on page 22

831
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I remember 7 years.

832
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,500
exemptions from

833
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,700
a quotation tax

834
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,300
that is to be collected according to the Customs Act.

835
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:38,000
So paragraph three and four of part state that British and Canadian coins.

836
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,000
and foreign gold coin

837
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,700
our Exempted from importation tax

838
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,900
and the application of the Customs tax.

839
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,500
setup

840
01:21:51,100 --> 01:22:02,800
4 of part 11 says point of any metal but fossilized weight and designed Fisher for use as currency under the authority of the government of any country. So this would include the United States.

841
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:04,900
are exempt from

842
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:12,200
a partition tax and therefore collection of the importation tax 100 Customs out.

843
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,900
And it follows that if if there is no tax.

844
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,200
to be paid

845
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:27,800
and the Customs act does not it does not need to be enforced. There's no point to declare things that we're not needed to be.

846
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,800
Taxed and this is why your point if I take it is

847
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,800
it it's

848
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,200
no tax and Photon are good. And there's no you do not have to clear that we come to the Border.

849
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:42,100
That is correct. And that is not following that logic. It's someone right at the

850
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:42,800
border with fresh fruit.

851
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,800
From another country

852
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,200
you're saying it wouldn't have to.

853
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,100
Declare that because no tax on.

854
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:58,000
It's so far as the fruits that you this not use fruit as an example because there's a agricultural but where does that fit into your

855
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,500
and the cutlet?

856
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,200
What fruit?

857
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:07,800
Fruits will not be declared under Customs. It would be declared as under the agriculture or not.

858
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:23,200
Yes, but one for taxation purposes, but for germs and for other certification purposes, well, let's use a car your personal car or an object that is not subject to the other cultural or not.

859
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:31,100
Like the coins like inner objects, the car that I was driving was not subject to the importation of dice.

860
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:37,700
But but did you buy that car in the United States? I did not so guess that during the what the word imported me.

861
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:51,300
Does the word important only mean bringing Goods that you required outside the country as poet returning Goods that came from Canada and are bringing back to Canada's incorrect. I believe it's the distinction is not.

862
01:23:52,800 --> 01:24:02,200
On what deportation means but on whether the taxes payable the car was no doubt imported because it was outside the country in the morning. It was inside the country in the afternoon.

863
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,100
if you look like

864
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:19,600
so, can you remind me of the the section I'm material doesn't have it and I'm going to go look for it later my book of authorities, unfortunately, or

865
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:30,600
There's a problem with it. Yeah, so, can you just repeat to me exactly the thank you. That's where I wasn't clear and I didn't have it.

866
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:37,200
I'm sorry. It just scheduled three part 11 points three and four.

867
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,400
Okay. Thank you.

868
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:59,900
If you bring for example other foodstuffs that are for example chips or things that are not subject to agricultural controls. You do not have to report it to report it. In fact many people try to cross the border to buy their groceries and they come back.

869
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:13,600
Does not have to be before it the same day that I came in with these coins. I have also bought some water a bottle of water and some petting mitigation. I had a headache that day medication is also exempt from taxation.

870
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:25,000
Which is the reason why I did not have to report it. My car did not have to be reported because tax on it had already been paid when the car was initially imported into Canada. So

871
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,300
it was not subject because it was not something on which.

872
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:30,900
You had already

873
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:36,600
because there was no tax filing on it those nuts to do to be collected.

874
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,700
It's not because it was important.

875
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,700
Okay, so we got your point now we have to worry because you have

876
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,100
baseball

877
01:25:50,800 --> 01:26:16,900
Wow, the evidence submitted by the defendant which was only paragraph only the Customs Act is the only evidence he had to offer in support of his position that the goods are running the judge found that that position and that evidence is not helpful to his to his point and he found that in fact according to the customer to the Currency Act. The coins are in fact courtesy and legal tender in the United States or

878
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,600
and they are not good.

879
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,200
according to the Customs Act

880
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,500
not according to the evidence.

881
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,200
Okay, what's your point

882
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,000
in order for him to find that they were good? She had to introduce some evidence of his own.

883
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:43,000
that was nothing that was waiting based on what is defendant said he never

884
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,200
Found this right?

885
01:26:58,900 --> 01:26:59,400
Okay, so

886
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,600
You mean that he's bringing up an argument that was not put to it.

887
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,900
Is that what you're saying it just argue. That is correct.

888
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:15,600
Okay, so it was a new argument that was not put by the parties before?

889
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,600
Okay, that's a different. Yeah.

890
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,700
And which paragraph?

891
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,100
Okay decision.

892
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:02,300
six

893
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:06,600
exercise

894
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,300
this definition was not the owner

895
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:16,500
know. But yeah, it was before it once you put the mat.

896
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,500
Judge has to look at that the act as a whole cannot just read the acronym look at the definition.

897
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:29,100
However, the the defendant did not submit that this is the reason why he thinks the coins are

898
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,800
ya good. It's a matter of you.

899
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:35,100
See that terms of law you can agree you can see.

900
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,000
the church

901
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,500
So the Act was before

902
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,000
and it's not like he looked at.

903
01:28:44,200 --> 01:29:01,400
This definition of money. There's not a normative. It is only its context there's specific to section 1.3. Unfortunately my in my this is a very long section of the definitions is very long. I did not include it and in my

904
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:01,900
authority,

905
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:20,800
but at the heading of it says that this this definition only implies for that's Obsession. It's not a general definition of money, which does not exist in any law do not have a definition of legal definition for one money is this is only a placeholder the same.

906
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,500
rewriting the same long paragraph

907
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:33,200
Okay, so it cannot be just for the purpose of 1.3 has to be for the purpose of Park nine.

908
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,700
The definition

909
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:47,200
is adapted in part nine. So subtraction 1:23. So what you're saying, it applies only to the part or wherever it says that it applies. That

910
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:47,700
is correct.

911
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,300
Not in another act.

912
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,100
That's correct.

913
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,000
Okay, that's good.

914
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,500
So what did he do that with that? I don't think that he

915
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:03,300
so this was the only basis on which he found the coins can be considered Goods.

916
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,300
Nothing in the defendants or the planets because of patients to give.

917
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,300
Any evidence that they can be considered quotes?

918
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,300
Too long. I'm in arguments you have left.

919
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,000
I have

920
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:57,500
just before just just raise the Damned because we we cannot

921
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:07,800
okay the honor the third of 53 of the reasons for the judge called analysis of white coins are currency, but the person that reporting under section 12 of the customs.

922
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,000
that is

923
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:27,800
5345 for a section 12 one of Customs are therefore triggered.

924
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,800
Yes, but you were under 10,000.

925
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,400
My point is that I believe this is a

926
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,700
it doesn't like you.

927
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,300
It does apply to me, but if it should it should the limit of 10,000 should apply to me.

928
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,600
Yes, so

929
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,700
in case I did have more than 10,000 I should have had to to report them.

930
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:51,600
Yes, but he does say that it is.

931
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:58,500
Yes, he uses the word. The reporting obligation is provided other section 12 of the

932
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:58,800
Customs

933
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,100
not.

934
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,200
his analysis pertained to

935
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,900
I don't see the word customized me proceeds.

936
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,300
act here's this process that

937
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:14,800
in the first sentence, but the second sentence he talks about the reporting obligations.

938
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:15,600
you know, but

939
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:21,300
the reporting obligation provided for at section 121 of the proceed.

940
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,200
That customers. Yeah.

941
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:13,100
The official version is perceived at

942
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,300
the correct. Yes.

943
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,400
Perfect. So we'll leave that.

944
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:17,900
Okay, so

945
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:18,900
at this point false.

946
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,600
You may have incorrect it. I know that this was corrected.

947
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,900
at some point for Aires

948
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,100
Not that I recall.

949
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,100
Okay, that's fine.

950
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:38,100
instead of the official version

951
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:45,900
of the website

952
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:51,600
from the official version.

953
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:59,000
Well, I will take your word. I believe this is a few mistake to make and it'll be awesome.

954
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,600
So let's go to the next one

955
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,600
the next one.

956
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:21,200
but overlooks specifically section 501

957
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:26,300
Which deals with the importation the only generally looks at?

958
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,400
This I probably maybe might not even if

959
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,800
you can write. Okay next.

960
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:39,500
Because we don't have a choice. We have their appeals this afternoon and your friend ask is entitled to his time.

961
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,700
You are on a

962
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,400
motion for summary judgment

963
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:48,700
It should be.

964
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:56,300
It should not be granted. Okay?

965
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:16,400
some of judgment the judge needs to have confidence in his so sufficient evidence must be available that he can confidently determine the matter if you

966
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,000
Well 58 is goods are broken sensor 68.

967
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,100
6868

968
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:50,000
having concluded both the customers and the proceeds are applied by currently. I will address the issue of overlapping provisions.

969
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:57,800
And then he discusses the character further below it that paragraph 70 the course. I recognized the scope and application.

970
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,300
Okay.

971
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,200
And he talks about conflict on overlap.

972
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:01,600
Okay,

973
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,900
so that's the wording of complex.

974
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,100
Yes.

975
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:06,700
You're saying.

976
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,400
Absolutely.

977
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:33,100
has not argue that the coins they probably said

978
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,300
oh.

979
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:46,700
Which is part of the motion record.

980
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:54,900
So

981
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:59,100
Benjamin paragraph 915 of the year?

982
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:10,700
Exactly that point,

983
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,500
okay.

984
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:19,000
So 65 page paragraph 9. Okay next.

985
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:25,900
You are pet the other significant errors that had.

986
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:27,900
felt was

987
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,600
135 is

988
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,100
for judicial review

989
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:48,000
By the cost of job so means that there's the decision of the minister not.

990
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,300
Not to try to delete his own decision based on Fresh evidence.

991
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:01,300
But there is

992
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:06,600
un-french that a new evidence. That's the purpose of doing it by way of action.

993
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:08,100
No, honor.

994
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,400
but as part of

995
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,200
I'm very sorry. I have to disagree.

996
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,800
No, okay, but let's do this with

997
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:22,700
you in a very short time.

998
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:24,400
It's three hours.

999
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,800
I understand

1000
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:29,000
we are bound by the Chief Justice duration.

1001
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:55,400
Review The Minister's conservation of the evidence beforehand. Yes, and whether he reached a conclusion in a intelligible manner according to dance more.

1002
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:13,700
so the minister that the plaintiff has a chance to defend against it how

1003
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:20,600
Was that he was not deciding the action he was deciding a summary judgment based on a question of law.

1004
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:32,800
So if you say it was not enough to determine that question to to strike the action say that and then we'll pass the next one.

1005
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:36,900
Because there are two different things it was not deciding the action.

1006
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:42,100
It was deciding whether there was a genuine issue.

1007
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:48,000
Yes a genuine issue about whether or not the corns.

1008
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:04,600
was requested so he had to find whether he would be

1009
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:06,500
What?

1010
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,800
I didn't mention is that in order?

1011
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,000
my place at the minister

1012
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:18,300
said

1013
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:26,600
and this alone should have been grounded to find that the decision should be set up even before looking at whether the goods.

1014
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,500
He didn't need an extra urgent.

1015
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,300
Well, that is all I can say in the time that I've been here. Yes,

1016
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:41,200
and that's bent you've covered all your points.

1017
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:47,900
So thank you very much. You've done very well and you will have a short time for you buy after you hear the other

1018
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:48,200
side.

1019
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:49,400
Thank you.

1020
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:54,800
So

1021
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,200
your honor in terms of the amendment of you?

1022
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:01,500
If you've read the crowns that random fact and law.

1023
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:20,400
He is really covered all very squarely by the decision of this court and table and I don't propose to take you through it that sets out the the standard of a few very clearly. And in fact, this case is the only case that sighted for the proposition. That

1024
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,600
was what happened.

1025
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:36,200
So the crowd submission is that the standard of you would apply to both.

1026
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:40,400
As either A or B and so in this case.

1027
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,100
I'm not sure that right. Yes.

1028
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:55,300
That was the point.

1029
01:41:55,300 --> 01:42:10,700
So no evidence is required to a Cold Justice crisis decision that the Amendments have no Prospect of success. He was entitled to look at the the pleadings on their face the proposed amendments without getting into any evidence beyond that

1030
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:12,500
and that was your position before.

1031
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:13,100
Yes

1032
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:15,900
reading the key things per se.

1033
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:22,400
It was enough to come to work. Yes.

1034
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:36,700
Okay

1035
01:42:36,700 --> 01:43:12,400
with respect to the second appeal for some reason the the test of course is set up very clearly that Justice Gleason was to consider the testing and react and molded that case also sets up the standard overview for this court an appellate review the first level or the second level. In fact, it deals with the upload a colored review at the Supreme Court level the crowd submission is that that same standard applies in this court in dealing with emotion for summary judgment where the federal court deals with it, but other than a Persona series

1036
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,600
You agree that 221 is a motion to strike.

1037
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,700
Yes 2

1038
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:25,200
15 is the rule for the summer third,

1039
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:25,500
right?

1040
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:26,200
So

1041
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:27,900
and

1042
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:42,300
frankly, I have some difficulty and that's why I'm raising it just speaking for myself at this stage and we decided in anything but I have some difficulty with the argument.

1043
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:47,200
You cannot add an action.

1044
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,700
parts

1045
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:54,800
purpose

1046
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:17,500
rather than remove them and separate them as different action there. You would have to mold maybe bring emotion to strike on the 2.1.

1047
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,800
Either because no reason no cost. No children.

1048
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:37,200
I just can't understand why you say I'm going to try other things just because you feel that 135 should be on its own.

1049
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:41,600
The crown like substance over form over substance

1050
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:51,100
the crown did bring emotion to strike and that was dismissed by proprietary motion ski, she suggested that there's motion for some regiments.

1051
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:58,100
Respect to which portion of the action?

1052
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:09,100
Again, related to the question of law simply boiled down to whether the conduct an issue could be resolved by determining whether the coins are Goods or not.

1053
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,800
Because that is the only conduct that was an issue in.

1054
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:22,200
The plaintiff's

1055
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,400
claims,

1056
01:45:24,400 --> 01:46:02,000
of course, the cling can be framed however, a plaintiff wishes and it can be very expensive particularly where things are acting in person. But nonetheless the only issues with the federal court will consider is the question of in this case whether the coins are goods and Justice League was very clear about that point that section the Customs act provides a very limited review in this. It's not really an ordinary action at all. It's a statutory appeal by way about

1057
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:05,300
keep to

1058
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:17,300
this would be the key question to all the planes because my question to you is not whether you can put them in the same proceeding which is procedural. Okay?

1059
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:22,800
What courts do when things are put together? That should not be put together?

1060
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:25,300
a separate them

1061
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,600
They don't just strike it.

1062
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Unless there is no mirror, but you have to have emotion nothing at the middle of the other stuff.

1063
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:47,800
If you're saying to me and that's what I heard that this one question was determinative of all of the other plans. That's a different story, but I couldn't see it when I read.

1064
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:55,600
Now it was not evident to me just because I didn't see it, you know.

1065
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,200
That one question. Are you good?

1066
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,700
Is enough to determine the merits of all the other times?

1067
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:16,000
I take your point, but obviously Justice Gleason. Yes.

1068
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Okay, so that he thinks differently is another story

1069
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:29,000
and the crown submits that the only issue that was the required any review whatsoever. Whether it's by summary judgment or at a trial.

1070
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:34,200
Claim was whether the goods are whether their coins are Goods.

1071
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:41,200
I assume that you try to convince him of that. So now is your time to practice convince us of that.

1072
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,900
But that's the point here

1073
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:47,400
if the coins are not good. They're then clearly the defendant loses the case.

1074
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,400
It's full stop and if the coins are good.

1075
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,600
What else is available to my friend under a statutory of this is not

1076
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:57,100
an actually.

1077
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:13,400
What would you be losing?

1078
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:36,300
I think it's fair to say that Justice Gleason that there was no Prospect of success for those claims. There may not have been a specific motion before him at the time to strike those Clans emotion had as I said in brought previously to strike and have been dismissed.

1079
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:38,200
So that's not very good for you.

1080
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:49,400
so somebody

1081
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,600
in this case, is that Mr.

1082
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:56,300
Oh sure

1083
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:58,600
has the right.

1084
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:02,600
To present his argument as to whether to be strive.

1085
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:03,700
Yes. So

1086
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:04,800
let's start from there.

1087
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:26,300
If the court disagrees with Justice Gleason that those ancillary claims should not have been struck then if you if you follow through on that proposition, then you can make a determination on emotional for some reason whether the coins are goods and allow the rest of the things to proceed and set it back to federal court and rest assured like

1088
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:31,300
okay, but you see my point I do just wait.

1089
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,600
here

1090
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:10,500
then we'd be fine, but I don't see how you

1091
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:17,600
I just and I'm not talking for my credit just me so convinced me.

1092
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:22,100
You know if you think you can't but procedure.

1093
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,900
You know, he hasn't 135.

1094
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:25,500
Yes,

1095
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:32,900
and yes, I write of action maybe for damages and for whatnot. Maybe he's wrong. Okay.

1096
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:55,000
Well that the coins are good. It's difficult to conceive that he would have a clean for Humanity of Damages because he hasn't alleged that he was mistreated in their way by border officers,

1097
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:55,600
Daniel.

1098
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:57,800
Yes.

1099
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:00,600
Okay now have you considered?

1100
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:16,400
He responsible for fraud.

1101
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:22,700
So that would be easy for you to produce cases. Yes.

1102
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:26,100
And last year as until June.

1103
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:28,800
6

1104
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:29,500
June

1105
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:32,000
7th so many days do you need to

1106
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,200
as many as you relationships, but I don't need much time.

1107
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:41,700
So an extra day because you'll start looking now, of course, so by the 9th,

1108
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:42,300
yes.

1109
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:31,900
So, you know.

1110
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:49,900
When we send it back, there may be a lot more hurdle under them reasonable cause of action on its face just because of the warning the communication and whatnot. Yes. Okay, you're all following on that.

1111
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:50,800
I am. Yes,

1112
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:51,100
okay.

1113
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:57,700
Okay. Now you want to say anything else about the Amendments or are you

1114
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:05,300
yes

1115
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:06,400
now?

1116
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:13,300
Can you show me where they work?

1117
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:38,000
They weren't stuck. It's just made the comments. So in fact, no that's right. They were not actually struck that he simply decided the issue about whether the coins are goods. And then of course whether they're points are currently and subject to his findings. He decided to dismiss the entire action.

1118
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:39,900
with he didn't strike it

1119
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:41,600
he just

1120
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:47,800
You realize how it becomes very important.

1121
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:57,900
Yes, you would have to find that the ruling on coins as goods and currency was determinative of all the claims in the plaintiff's claim.

1122
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:01,600
or that procedure form

1123
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:04,800
Yes.

1124
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:11,700
You override the substance and you can just because you haven't put it on in the same state.

1125
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:12,600
Yes.

1126
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:22,400
So

1127
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:36,900
in the federal court, the crown of the position of the coins are Goods Justice Gleason found that they are both goes in currency and a lot of appeal to this court. The crown is having to support Justice Gleason's ruling on both those points.

1128
01:54:38,900 --> 01:55:04,100
The crown referred to settle pieces of legislation before Justice Gleason the crown repeat those submissions. But in addition the crown is rely on the Customs tariff, which I started in the memorandum as well as two cases decided under the federal export and important permits. Both are fairly old cases, but they made their point of

1129
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:04,900
okay.

1130
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:25,200
In my own mind the first one I would like you to clarify if you can is the proposition that if something there's no tax to be paid. It doesn't need to be declared on yes. There's an obligation to declare under another act

1131
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:27,000
right that is not

1132
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:27,700
stuck with that.

1133
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:39,700
But it's absolutely false if the broad during the trip to be declared it must be

1134
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:47,700
Absolutely must be reported. Even if there's no tax is to be paid on it in terms of custom duties because they need each.

1135
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:53,200
Okay. So where do we have that provision that says if you exceed you?

1136
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:57,100
Yes 48 hours. That's all it is.

1137
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:58,900
Where do we have that provision?

1138
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:05,000
So you're looking for the specific provision and the customers are

1139
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,600
yes, because you say that.

1140
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:11,300
so

1141
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:12,700
yes,

1142
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:18,300
so I reproduced provisions of the Customs act that the end of my

1143
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:23,300
memorandum of but those particular Provisions would

1144
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:25,900
out in the regulations, which

1145
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:27,200
as you

1146
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:30,400
not believe I have reproduced in full.

1147
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:36,100
So I would have to provide that to you subsequently.

1148
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,800
We have the customer service.

1149
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:40,400
Yes.

1150
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:42,200
Exactly. Yeah,

1151
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:42,500
no

1152
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:46,500
because you do realize that that was one of his main artist.

1153
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:47,300
throughout

1154
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:50,600
it's not an interior.

1155
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:59,300
Well, it's a bit of a surprise argument for that. It's just because there is no Duty owing a good doesn't have to be reported.

1156
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:11,700
For example, let's take it the keys out of this case. If the ghosts are currency if their value is an excessive 10,000 dollars

1157
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:12,800
Express seat.

1158
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,800
Yes, they have to be reported but there's no taxable on those.

1159
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:18,400
Yes, but I think what the shoes

1160
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,800
yes,

1161
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:26,400
there could be a series of other stations.

1162
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:34,200
so

1163
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:41,400
We need something tangible other than it makes no it's false. So.

1164
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:45,800
I thought that that argument was raised in the

1165
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,300
after announcement

1166
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:56,500
if it is, but I mean, are you asking for this citation to the regulation that

1167
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:58,100
I want a piece?

1168
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,800
There's no case.

1169
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:03,500
Okay,

1170
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:21,900
what I could do what I can offer to the court is when the time comes from it and the case law on the Frog of the public servant I can provide as well to reference to the specific provision in the regulation that the deals with a specific limits.

1171
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:26,000
We don't want to extend this if you could provide.

1172
01:58:48,400 --> 01:59:03,000
The second section will be whatever you have to say about the regulation that is being raised in the okay. This is not a memorandum. Okay, all this must not be more than five pages.

1173
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:04,000
all

1174
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:13,500
I just want that to be put

1175
01:59:53,800 --> 02:00:11,300
because he the plaintiff paid and this is called US dollars for these 5700 for these coins when in fact that represented 29.5 times their face value.

1176
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:12,500
So

1177
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:20,600
so there's an obligation to disclose it just because it was over is exemption. Yes, whether or not there was definitely

1178
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:29,300
And are you going to address the urine deportation of those Provisions that if you push us through?

1179
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:30,000
Yes.

1180
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:37,000
Unless you have any further questions. Those are always missions.

1181
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:49,100
So the provisions that you asked about the regulations the limits.

1182
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:30,500
well lady I have I mean I can take you through Justice Gleason's decision and detail, but the Supreme Court of Canada has said that you know, the

1183
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:37,100
Pellet report does not need to conduct the same analysis that was conducted by the federal.

1184
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:39,300
Sorry. This is a question of milk.

1185
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:41,100
Yes question of no. Yes.

1186
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:45,100
Okay. So are we here that some question of North Korea's?

1187
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:45,500
Yes.

1188
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:49,700
Okay, so why are not are we not conducting it ourselves?

1189
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:55,400
So his question was that Justice Gleason is arguments that Justice.

1190
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:07,300
just because that particular section is not referred to expressly Injustice and the decision doesn't mean that that

1191
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:11,800
Legislation was cited to him act was before him.

1192
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:13,500
he

1193
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:21,400
refer to numerous pieces of legislation in his decision dealing with currently.

1194
02:02:55,400 --> 02:03:00,500
So let's say you had drugs manure and decides to bring back its.

1195
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:03,600
under 1000 and by the

1196
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:06,900
$1 bill that are over

1197
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:09,900
VIP that it doesn't have to be carried up.

1198
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:14,700
Yes, because he has to declare it as good. It's not money laundering. It's

1199
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:19,200
you bring the flowing hair dollar coin, which I

1200
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:34,800
Refer to my memory and there's a picture of it at the back of my book of authorities. If you brought that and brought it into Canada, you would have to declare it as a good because purchased it. Well, the last time it was bought it was bought for 10 million dollars US.

1201
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:44,100
You don't have to declare it under the proceeds of finding money longer. Yeah, because the face value is less than 10000 dollars Canadian.

1202
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:54,700
Declared only as a good the proceeds Act only comes into play if the face value of the money that may or may not be longer is over 10,000 dollars.

1203
02:03:57,100 --> 02:04:11,800
And what about if that's right, then you can put to the bank or in your I'm just I'm just puzzled by the fact that you don't think that people have to declare.

1204
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:12,500
Well

1205
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:16,700
the million dollar they bring in it's just because it's on Facebook.

1206
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:30,200
Yes. I understand really the money laundering provisions of the process of climactic not apply to collectible coins that have a very low face value but a very high fair market value.

1207
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:46,100
It's like bringing in diamonds. The proceeds act just doesn't apply in terms of money ordering even though a drug Smuggler or a terrorist can bring one diamond and it's easily over ten thousand dollars. It's different legislation that applies to catch that.

1208
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:52,600
precedes Act only applies to the implication of actual currency and only

1209
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:02,000
I would have to check but I believe.

1210
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:08,500
Well, no.

1211
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:11,300
we have a judgment that

1212
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:12,900
based on that and we don't have we

1213
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:16,300
have the provision that is an issue whether but we don't have

1214
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:22,000
we don't have the entire act before the court in my in my local history.

1215
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:23,700
And yeah, but

1216
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:25,500
yeah the specific provision.

1217
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:39,600
So the reporting that if we know can react phase but

1218
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:43,900
it is understood by the Water Service officers that they are to buy that.

1219
02:05:50,900 --> 02:06:05,000
Yes, I mean it's suitable you could have old Canadian dollar bills that are worth much more than one dollar right now, but still with not be within the 10,000 11 without me over. They don't have to be declared.

1220
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:14,500
Because of their Facebook but if the terrorists goes to sell it, you know and pains more than 10,000 dollars. Obviously. That's a problem.

1221
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:29,200
Respect of the Declaration for good and money. Yes.

1222
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:33,600
And you rely on your written submission?

1223
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:34,100
Yes.

1224
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:35,800
And that's

1225
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:45,700
well look in terms of the question. You asked me did the Justice please and consider section 11 of the currency actors to take one of my friends arguments.

1226
02:06:46,400 --> 02:07:00,100
At paragraph 50 of Justice Gleason's reasons for decision the votes almost a page and a half of his reasons for decision to citing Section 8, for example, the Customs Act.

1227
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:08,700
I simply want to raise the point that the game that he simply because he hasn't specifically cited section 11 doesn't mean he didn't

1228
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:10,700
considered.

1229
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:12,300
Yes.

1230
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:38,600
Yes, so is there something wrong in this video?

1231
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:42,300
No.

1232
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,800
I don't think I'm following it. But

1233
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:55,600
let's look at paragraph 65 to judge is the plaintiff has not argued that the coins have found to be good. For example.

1234
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:05,000
I see what your pointing as whether or not

1235
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,700
yes. Yes.

1236
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:09,700
Absolutely accurate on that point.

1237
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:10,600
I

1238
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:17,500
would have to take you to his notice his written representations file in response to the motion for summary judgment.

1239
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:19,400
So let's look at

1240
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:34,600
That problem with my book on page.

1241
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,400
factor for the people

1242
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:49,900
above value 1 in 102 Dash 18

1243
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:56,200
to look at

1244
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:03,600
I think you're saying it should be it should be page 121.

1245
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:09,400
Okay that can you look at your book and it may be one page

1246
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:12,700
1214.

1247
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:47,400
No.

1248
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:54,900
anyway

1249
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:04,000
Whether or not the judge accepted as if

1250
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,900
an issue exactly yes. Yes, that's the point of situation way

1251
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:12,900
and you don't have nine and tell us if you think it's the same argument that they've got 65

1252
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:16,400
because maybe it's not the same argument.

1253
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:22,900
Well, the

1254
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:24,700
plaintiff has been admitted.

1255
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:25,500
the evidence

1256
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:33,900
Is paid 5700 us for the points? So clearly that if the coins are good that would trigger the reporting requirements.

1257
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:56,300
So what do we have at 9?

1258
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:08,500
But now we're talking about the difference in nine we're talking about.

1259
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,700
which is a neighboring which

1260
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:25,400
you can section 12 1 of the question Act.

1261
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:33,300
All Goods that are important shawl except in such circumstances subject that may be prescribed the reported to the news.

1262
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:35,900
So all Goods that are important.

1263
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:38,600
Yes, so

1264
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:40,700
you're saying that argument?

1265
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:47,600
I think that argument must have been made to the judge because the

1266
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:53,400
pleaded that he paid an amount and accessibility allowable limit not to report

1267
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:56,600
so we did Judge and spoke when he says the argument.

1268
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:01,300
It's possible, but I don't see that anything turns

1269
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:01,500
out.

1270
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:08,400
Okay, that's yes.

1271
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:20,000
I didn't anticipate that the plaintiff is going to take issue with something on this with respect to this particular sentence in just

1272
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:22,700
That point in his memorandum.

1273
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:27,100
Okay, so that board has nothing to remember and food.

1274
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,100
and it's not

1275
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:32,700
Okay, I don't see anything turning on.

1276
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:51,100
Okay. The next point was a paragraph 68.

1277
02:12:55,700 --> 02:13:01,300
The reference to the fact that there are overlapping for vision in itself shows.

1278
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:21,600
Just the mere fact that they're open up does not mean that there's a conflict and what Justice Gleason did was review all of the different pieces of relevant legislation very clearly and crafts together.

1279
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:28,400
The clear the clear proposition that could that point these collector coins are votes.

1280
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:45,600
There was no easy answer for him. There was no definition of money in any of his eyes, but by looking at all of the piece of legislation, which he has carefully sited at length in his long decision. He found as a fact that points are Goods.

1281
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:48,400
Yeah, that's a matter of law.

1282
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:49,000
Yes.

1283
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:56,700
There is no restructure.

1284
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:03,900
Okay, the next point that was raised and

1285
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:16,800
the happiness argues that this question knowing was not a knot and the judge at also consider.

1286
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:21,800
whether the decision under appeal was otherwise

1287
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:36,300
the federal court on the motion for southern was to the term and whether the coins were Goods or currency or both.

1288
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:43,000
An outcome of that determination was determinate of the entire statutory appeal.

1289
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:47,600
There was no need to allow any of the other claims to proceed.

1290
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:50,600
And Justice League so far.

1291
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:57,400
And the ministerial decision to be clear was not.

1292
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:10,700
Technically something that he judicially reviewed. This is a statue of action. So Justice Gleason technically did not need to consider the ministerial decision Beyond its actual outcome

1293
02:15:10,700 --> 02:15:11,800
because it's you know,

1294
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:12,200
yes.

1295
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:15,900
What different evidence?

1296
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:16,400
Yes.

1297
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:19,800
Okay.

1298
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:55,900
Yes,

1299
02:15:55,900 --> 02:15:57,100
so you're not

1300
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:57,800
no,

1301
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:58,600
okay.

1302
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:14,500
Whatever the merits you have to go by the rules,

1303
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:14,800
absolutely.

1304
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Okay, I think.

1305
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:28,900
We're talking when you type of the goods that have been reported you say there was ahead and reported with those internet of your attention.

1306
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:37,900
Doctor said first referred to percentage of your personal limitation personal exemption.

1307
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:49,700.0000000009313
Yes. Yes, that's true. But here the goods were clearly accessible. Yes, as a matter of law. Yes. The only time he has to report Goods is if it's over the I believe it's a hundred dollars. Okay.

1308
02:16:49,700.0000000009313 --> 02:16:58,799.9999999990687
Yes. I

1309
02:16:58,799.9999999990687 --> 02:17:02,200.00000000093132
know that I have no I'm not bringing back anything that I have to

1310
02:17:02,200.00000000093132 --> 02:17:02,700.0000000009313
declare.

1311
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:12,400
You have to disclose that he's bought Goods, but they did not subject to the reporting requirements under the Customs. Act was the first person's Act.

1312
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,000
Yes, see instead of buying.

1313
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,299.9999999990687
Yes.

1314
02:17:20,700.0000000009313 --> 02:17:24,200.00000000093132
He wouldn't have happened.

1315
02:17:24,200.00000000093132 --> 02:17:25,200.00000000093132
No.

1316
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:37,799.9999999990687
But technically to answer your question Lord, he would have had to say yes. I have bought Goods, but I have nothing to be quit. He couldn't simply say I have not purchased any good surge during

1317
02:17:37,799.9999999990687 --> 02:17:41,400
my trip because on the form it says do you bring any good over the

1318
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:56,100
minute on the form? Yes, but if you're actually asked this was a land Crossing if you're asked by the Border Services officers squarely having purchased anything abroad technically. You should say I haven't purchased anything over that you

1319
02:18:04,700.0000000009313 --> 02:18:07,200.00000000093132
that there are exemptions.

1320
02:18:08,299.9999999990687 --> 02:18:15,500
And I will provide those things actually provide exception to section 12. Yes.

1321
02:18:19,299.9999999990687 --> 02:18:23,500
You all have those exemptions when we travel abroad typically for alcohol. Everybody knows that.

1322
02:18:37,799.9999999990687 --> 02:18:42,200.00000000093132
And that's regardless of whether or not you're obliged to pay taxes.

1323
02:18:42,200.00000000093132 --> 02:18:42,400
Yes.

1324
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:45,200.00000000093132
Because

1325
02:18:45,200.00000000093132 --> 02:18:49,299.9999999990687
those exemptions did not apply to the plaintiff. I

1326
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:52,400
did not like authorities, but I will provide

1327
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:53,200.00000000093132
okay.

1328
02:19:03,700.0000000009313 --> 02:19:17,500
Like client is successful in this court. My client will ask for cost of the appeals but successful was divided in the court below so it would only be respect to the appeals and like when you have to have access to

1329
02:19:41,200.00000000093132 --> 02:19:52,700
have to concede that's success would be divided to that.

1330
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:59,700
And in the first instance, you did say each part you better in it.

1331
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:00,300
Don't go. Yes.

1332
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:04,200
Success was clearly divided before Justice.

1333
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:07,800
Thank you.

1334
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,400
Reply is just about what to say.

1335
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:14,700
Okay.

1336
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:27,900
However there my friend made quite a few actually responded but quite a few points. I'd like to start with 101 the amendment here.

1337
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:38,900
Was relied on her neck in order to drive.

1338
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:42,000
the principles under which

1339
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:47,100
amendment may be struck her up is was

1340
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:49,800
he can't this is in your memory?

1341
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:10,600
the amendment

1342
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:17,700
to refuse the interfuse the amendment. Yes, and you've already told us about the jurisprudence.

1343
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:26,000
Yes, however, several would not apply just don't do the Supreme Court and

1344
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,500
whatnot. So why it wouldn't apply

1345
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:35,600
developed because it was guidance for summary judgment motions. Not for many emotions.

1346
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:36,600
Perfect next.

1347
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:37,600
next

1348
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:45,600
my friend said

1349
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:57,600
That did not allow this treatment, which is not correct. One of those specific claims is against popular debut for threats and

1350
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:03,200
try to yes, and then you you're saying

1351
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:14,300
Okay.

1352
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:38,400
Here there's fun. Also missed submissions about them limitations for officers or and you know Honor made a point about the hurdles.

1353
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:45,900
of having time limitations fortunately, in this case the timers of limitations have not even started

1354
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:46,700
we

1355
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:50,300
what do you

1356
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:52,900
find Farmers have not started the

1357
02:22:54,700 --> 02:23:01,800
Individuals are still expecting this Ransom payment for Return of the money. So that means that the

1358
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:06,200
fraught is continuing its not a finished transaction.

1359
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:07,500
Oh,

1360
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:08,100
it has not

1361
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:12,600
the judge didn't determined anything.

1362
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:14,400
No, that was a point. So

1363
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:22,100
you don't need to reply. I'm just I think we were discussing what you need to face later down the road if we return it.

1364
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:51,800
And about the basic section exemptions, there's fun and mix the arc the daily that respond makes the argument that some of the exemptions that come under schedule 3 of the exact Tax Act to apply which are the exemptions with respect to time spent outside the 800 dollars per day.

1365
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:52,600
Yes. Yeah.

1366
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:09,400
There are some exceptions with respecting

1367
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:30,600
my point my reply is that the same exemptions or the exemptions that that he refers to come from the same place as the exemption for coin they all come from schedule 3. So the point is if there is an exemption for time spent outside of Canada. This would be equally for all the other

1368
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:31,500
heels.

1369
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,900
is going to give us the regulation and you're gonna have

1370
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:49,200
so that's when it's easy to put their

1371
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:53,800
very well.

1372
02:24:56,400 --> 02:25:04,200
the respondent also stated at 8 that he wouldn't he would be happy that a Smuggler would declare a large sum of

1373
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:08,700
gold coins as goods and this

1374
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,400
however, he said

1375
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:25,500
I believe he said that depending on the amount of gold coins, there would have to be reported. However, they retired the drive of the upstairs apartment. Was that no amount?

1376
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:28,200
that there is no amount of

1377
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:32,900
no prescribed amount for coins know

1378
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:35,400
we're just we're not talking about the president.

1379
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:43,900
No amount of gold coins would have to be reported.

1380
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:46,000
No, he said they would have to be

1381
02:25:47,500 --> 02:25:56,600
so that's one section and then he didn't say that he said

1382
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:02,500
contradicts

1383
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:24,600
himself by saying that there is a limit and for the proceeds act the cbsa and is India and the evidence before the judge. There's a memo about precious metals where coins such as these and other financial instruments that are gold bars for example are not to be reported.

1384
02:26:25,700 --> 02:26:28,200
Okay, we cannot exist in the appears.

1385
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:42,700
to the precious metals

1386
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:57,000
and what is the temperature

1387
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:01,500
next exercise document?

1388
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:03,800
says that

1389
02:27:04,900 --> 02:27:05,100
that

1390
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:09,100
currency gold and silver precious metals

1391
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:32,400
So it's just in a different appeal.

1392
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:33,800
It is in both the Army.

1393
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:41,700
Okay, and that would be too I was actually document. So what is it that you're saying is a contradiction of what you said

1394
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:46,100
so that internal memo is trucks. Simply say officers is

1395
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:46,600
where

1396
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:49,500
No.

1397
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:50,400
because

1398
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:18,800
your page 100 of the appeal book, which is the second page of the metal.

1399
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:25,400
first second page of the mouth

1400
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:42,200
coins are also to be treated as goods and not as currency and not the word not is underlying.

1401
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:49,700
The last sentence of that of that paragraph says across border currency and monitor instrument report, which is formed

1402
02:28:49,700 --> 02:28:56,800
Easton this as anything it's a characteristic kitchen. How does that have to do with the procedure?

1403
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:06,000
Because it instructs the last sentence instructs officers. Do not require reporting under the monetary instrument.

1404
02:29:07,900 --> 02:29:08,900
regulations

1405
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:11,200
of course border currencies

1406
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:20,900
and that is without regard to the amount.

1407
02:29:54,100 --> 02:30:07,000
So I would give one minute after you're done for an answer from the other side because normally these things that are already raised by you have to be raised all in the first time around.

1408
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,900
I'm sorry, that's high pressure that I would like under.

1409
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:14,600
Yes. Pretty good. Okay. So with the next Point

1410
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:17,600
next point that makes is that

1411
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:33,900
that declaring financial instruments and gold currency under the Customs act would be sufficient reported. Even if they wanted is large such as a terrorist or a Smuggler the problem is that they

1412
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:55,300
The two reporting regimes address different names the person that reports go to the fin track organization, which is able to track and find patterns and financial movement. Whereas customers report only go to Industry Canada populations to find out generally how our economy is doing so a report

1413
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:59,600
First the Customs act would be would go under the radar.

1414
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:02,400
And they will not be able to.

1415
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:11,500
To find okay, but it has really not

1416
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:12,400
much application.

1417
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:16,600
Your case,

1418
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:20,500
I believe I believe this is exactly what the cbsa is trying to do

1419
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:22,700
know because you're under 1000.

1420
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,200
It doesn't apply to my case

1421
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,400
know it's what I'm saying.

1422
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:29,600
It doesn't apply to my four points, but my client that is

1423
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:36,600
a that's not

1424
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:43,100
the point next point.

1425
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:53,500
No, he said that you make the argument

1426
02:31:53,500 --> 02:32:05,400
is what would have been determinative and his

1427
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:17,500
About the Cog about the conflict.

1428
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:20,200
Where we're just glisten.

1429
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:29,500
Their Spanish says that there is international conflict. However it paragraph 72 of the decision just released him says there's no real content.

1430
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:34,400
And that implies that there is a conflict is just not to be seen as real.

1431
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:34,900
Yeah.

1432
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:56,500
The other with respect to the novel treatment of the of the case the denominator treatment applies to the action as a whole which means that every every claim in the action has to be considered the novel.

1433
02:32:57,100 --> 02:32:57,800
It doesn't mean that

1434
02:32:57,800 --> 02:33:00,100
the rest of the reaction was never before

1435
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:01,800
it's

1436
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:02,400
the first time.

1437
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:07,000
Yes. However, it doesn't mean that the

1438
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:27,100
appeal is expected section 135 needs to be determined the novel and even if it did if the judge had a lot of 35 from the beginning there was no evidence before and what's the weather of any contravention? There was no evidence of what was or was not important.

1439
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:30,600
the next

1440
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:43,600
there's all I have on

1441
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:49,300
how to and then I correct that it was not disputed that you did not declare those comments.

1442
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:49,700
Correct?

1443
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:52,600
It's not descriptive than they were fine.

1444
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:57,300
Or what their face value was and what their purchases?

1445
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:14,900
which is the officer that the search and the finding that he noted at the very end that he understands that the coins are technically currents, but

1446
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:22,400
he needs to treat him as Goods because of this metal. That is right.

1447
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:43,300
I would like yes, I do. Of course. Yes.

1448
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:51,200
You're not annoying. So, you know except for you this version and things like that.

1449
02:34:52,600 --> 02:35:06,800
Well your honor in the evening the motion to strike at the responded mate earlier in the case. I still have mental to time.

1450
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:40,000
Make the submission together with the others check my favorite work. And yes,

1451
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,700
and when you do that you have to put

1452
02:35:45,900 --> 02:35:59,100
it because the respondents conduct has been.

1453
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:09,800
A very heavy-handed and vacation. I like to point out.

1454
02:36:11,100 --> 02:36:11,700
that

1455
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:19,100
before you do this things the judge didn't find anything fixation or anything.

1456
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:21,900
No, I'm making point about costs on the appeal.

1457
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:25,600
Yes, but we haven't seen anything that says before I

1458
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:32,800
like to submit the letter that the respondent submitted to the registry with respect to the elements submission of

1459
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:45,200
Of the memoranda. He lied on the you know lyrics that the registry cleaning that the service was done in properly so far in this case that

1460
02:36:46,100 --> 02:36:51,200
there's bottom has fight every way possible to slow down and to make it more expensive to

1461
02:36:58,500 --> 02:36:59,800
it's all redeemed religious.

1462
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,100
You didn't ask for it. Then you remember and

1463
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:25,200
in my

1464
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:26,700
memorandum

1465
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:28,900
and none of the

1466
02:37:28,900 --> 02:37:30,500
yes,

1467
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:31,200
you know

1468
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:33,800
that's supposed to do for everything about Cooks.

1469
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:52,000
normal costs

1470
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:04,900
Now thank you very much

1471
02:38:04,900 --> 02:38:26,500
sure that bulletin free data Justice League Seasons ruler. It was a thing that during the discovery process prior to the motion for some reason. So obviously that fully would have to be updated with respect to the treatment of currency.

1472
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:28,400
Was it?

1473
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:33,500
It's not before the church

1474
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:34,300
it

1475
02:38:34,300 --> 02:38:36,600
why would it be in the

1476
02:38:36,600 --> 02:38:41,100
pill book? Because the well because the talent

1477
02:38:42,300 --> 02:38:47,600
the appellant has put several documents that were in a veil produced him and Discovery into the book

1478
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:50,800
while you're supposed to object to that.

1479
02:38:54,700 --> 02:38:56,400
yes, well lady he

1480
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:14,900
I did ask for us specific ruling that we'd be allowed to file separate books of authorities just as an example and that was granted. It was Justice Renny. There's a history in this file of not being able to agree on what documents should go into which books

1481
02:39:31,100 --> 02:39:40,400
it wasn't part of the evidence that the plaintiff submitted for his motion to Amendment.

1482
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:53,400
reasons

1483
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:58,400
to the extent that the bulletin

1484
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:00,000
Is

1485
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,100
a part of the evidence?

1486
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:05,800
Not that would have been an affidavit for the motion to strike.

1487
02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:15,400
That's the same. It's not the same work we're looking at what was on the record for the summer judgment motion and emotional

1488
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:19,300
they were different they were different affidavits filed for both.

1489
02:40:19,300 --> 02:40:21,100
So this would not have been

1490
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:21,900
know

1491
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:23,900
what you check your files

1492
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:30,600
the point.

1493
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:41,500
To take away though was the bulletin would have to be corrected. Give him Justice Gleason's ruling on currents.

1494
02:40:42,500 --> 02:40:50,500
Right the whole point here. Is that the bullets and seems to imply that the Border Services officers are not to treat collector coins as currency.

1495
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:56,600
And Justice Gleason in effect change the law. He said it's booked coins and curse.

1496
02:40:56,600 --> 02:40:57,500
Okay.

1497
02:40:59,700 --> 02:41:01,600
So what you're saying is that?

1498
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:05,900
This may have been an internal administrative.

1499
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:07,800
View,

1500
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:08,200
yes.

1501
02:41:09,100 --> 02:41:09,300
but

1502
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:14,200
it's not one that is in sync with the findings of Justice.

1503
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:18,700
Yes, and it predates justice questions through it.

1504
02:41:18,700 --> 02:41:27,100
And that's why I want to make sure that and that would be the sentence is in paragraph 53.

1505
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:29,600
Yes.

1506
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:30,900
because

1507
02:41:32,300 --> 02:41:33,300
they decide not to

1508
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:36,600
and that

1509
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:47,500
okay, so I understand here.

1510
02:41:57,900 --> 02:42:04,200
So thank you very much. We will take this on the reserve. He's

1511
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:14,600
order

1512
02:42:27,100 --> 02:42:28,000
sitting is now concluded.
