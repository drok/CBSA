1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,900
Order

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,834
The special sitting of the Federal Court
of Appeal is now open

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:18,604
 the Honourable Justice Gauthier, The Honorable
Mr. Justice Webb, and the Honourable Madam Justice Rivoalen are presiding.

4
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:23,940
The court calls file numbers
A-101-18 and A-102-18.

5
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:28,063
Radu Hociung and the Minister of Public
Safety and Emergency Preparedness.

6
00:00:28,063 --> 00:00:32,383
The Appellant will be representing himself
and Mr. Peterson will be representing the Respondent.

7
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:45,671
I think I saw you in the room yesterday,
so you know how we proceed.

8
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:51,777
It's your appeal, and you can rest assured that
we have read the material,

9
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:56,564
so you can start your representations

10
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:59,941
Good morning.

11
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:11,300
First a question: What is the meaning of "appeal"?

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:23,300
Is a request for the court to consider a decision of
 a lower court or another authority in decision-making capacity.

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,500
Is that about correct?

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,223
in this particular case, yesterday it was...

15
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:42,596
Now this is a motion, okay, and on a motion from a
trial court, we apply the standard of review that

16
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:49,493
 means how we judge whether we can intervene for an
error or not, according to a case called Housen.

17
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:55,247
If it is a question of law, we apply the
correctness... we see if it's correct.

18
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,668
And if it is mixed fact and law or thing or things
like that, which normally is

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,141
a question of summary judgment is normally
mix fact and law, maybe not in this case.

20
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:12,801
It's palpable and overriding error, and
that's a very high standard

21
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:19,024
we have to be convinced there was
no record, no evidence whatsoever to ground

22
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:23,969
the finding of the Federal Court

23
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,100
Of course. My question

24
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,064
okay with you understand it like that

25
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:34,010
My question was more general, somewhat more
general. It was directed to the word appeal

26
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:38,780
 not necessarily in this court. Because it is
referred, for example in the Federal Court...

27
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:42,140
 the case before us has to do with the Customs Act,

28
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:47,258
where there's a word there that says a decision of
the Minister may be appealed in the Federal Court.

29
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,521
Yes, but you have to be careful.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,500
What one understands of the word
"appeal" in a statute

31
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,129
does not always mean the same thing.
 The Supreme Court told us that in several statutes

32
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:07,784
 the word "appeal" means almost a judicial review,
 so it's like

33
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,626
It's a bit complicated. But in this case why is
relevant to your case because what is before us

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,307
Is the decision of Justice Gleeson

35
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,944
Yes, the decision of Justice Gleeson
was requested

36
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:36,605
No, don't worry. I mean this is

37
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,981
be relaxed.

38
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:45,317
 the first instance started as an appeal of
 a decision of the minister of Public Safety

39
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:52,608
section 135. The language in the Customs Act was

40
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,047
that the decision is appealed to the Federal
Court. So my question is what does the word

41
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:03,381
"appeal" mean in such a setting? does it not mean
I'm requesting the court to have a look

42
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:05,388
at The Minister's decision?

43
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:06,600
Yes.

44
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,004
But I'm not sure that this is really
all that relevant to what is before us

45
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,102
It will be.

46
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,699
Okay. So you explain that to us.

47
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:19,022
Second question is

48
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:25,138
in the context of the Federal Court,
what is an Act of Parliament?

49
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:29,287
My understanding is that it is...

50
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,582
That is... it's not a procedural.
It's not a procedural rule.

51
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,303
It is a piece of evidence. It's evidence of the
truth against which the court measures

52
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:46,908
An Act of Parliament is a statute or a regulation

53
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,200
Um,

54
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,300
that's an Act of Parliament

55
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,600
it is... that's correct. But what is it to you?
Is it evidence? Is it rules? Is it procedural?

56
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,207
It's law.

57
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:58,421
It's the law.

58
00:04:58,429 --> 00:04:59,681
it's the measuring stick.

59
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:00,818
Yes.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,189
so an Act of Parliament...

61
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,164
Sets out what the truth is.

62
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:12,216
The truth has nothing to do with the law.
The law is the law and the truth

63
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,435
relates to evidence.

64
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,603
All right.

65
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:21,185
So when you are asked to take an
Act of Parliament under judicial review

66
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,503
Does that not mean that

67
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:30,277
we're not taking an Act of Parliament under
judicial review, because under 135 we're looking

68
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:35,295
at the whether or not there is a contravention
that's a factual and legal question. 

69
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:38,107
If there was a contravention
under the Customs Act

70
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:41,943
We're not discussing the validity of the Customs Act.

71
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:48,728
My wording was was was poor.
What I meant to say is when you take

72
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:56,822
an Act of Parliament under judicial notice
according to the Canada Evidence Act

73
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,491
The Court has to take Acts of
Parliament as judicial notice

74
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,621
Does not mean that you

75
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:11,200
okay, where are they? Just we have two hours.
Okay, three hours for your two files.

76
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,273
It's nice if you want to raise all kinds of
preliminary questions, but you will have to get

77
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:20,616
to the meat that's what we have to decide.

78
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:23,542
very well. I will skip this one.

79
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,664
Very important question for me.
The original.. The first instance...

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,869
was in Federal Court and it was quite substantial
in terms of evidence provided. The appeal book

81
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,459
for the motion

82
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,400
for amendment, for summary judgment was substantial.

83
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:48,382
some 700 pages

84
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:50,105
my question to you is

85
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,087
given that my presentation today is... aims to
succeed at convincing you that there was an

86
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,530
overriding error and that you have to intervene

87
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,554
To what extent am I required to prove the facts

88
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,772
 of the orginal motion

89
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,145
Um, in other words,

90
00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:14,334
The only thing that is before us are the two Appeals.

91
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
Okay, the two appeal books.

92
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,100
For me it feels because one has several
so that's what before us.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,262
I don't know yet how you want to proceed. So if you
were to proceed then I would be helping you by

94
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:38,081
saying "do you have evidence". We can't
talk to that in the air.

95
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:47,311
Of course. My question is in case I convince
you that that your intervention is required

96
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,313
Would this case be returned back to the Federal
Court for the determination.

97
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,903
Would you determine the facts? Where would I ...

98
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:56,100
We don't determine facts.

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,800
So would it go back to the Federal Court then?

100
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,525
It depends on what basis we intervene.

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,662
We can't make findings of fact.

102
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:15,819
So if all the facts don't need to be determined
and it's a pure question of law, we can decide it.

103
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:19,800
If it's not that, if there's a
reassessment of the evidence.

104
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,038
Then we send it back.

105
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:27,653
All right, very good. Perfect. That answers to my first trip

106
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:32,467
 My last one is, I noticed a deficiency in my book of
authorities for the A-101 case,

107
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:35,663
which is the amendment,

108
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:39,442
I noticed that I entered the wrong

109
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,585
Section of the Federal Court Rules;
I would like to submit...

110
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:48,537
I don't have a book of authorities in 101

111
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:57,604
That's the Respondent's

112
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:02,574
ah, this thing... ok... and what
is it that is deficient?

113
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,714
Do you want to add something, is that it?

114
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:11,674
The Federal Court Rules I have I had quoted...
I meant to include Rule 76.

115
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,032
And 200 which are relevant to amendments.

116
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,300
Ok don't worry. We know the rules, we will find it.

117
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:20,692
All right. Very well.

118
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,950
So that ... I appreciate your time and patience
 and we're ready to begin

119
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,821
I'd like to start with 101, which
is the amendment motion.

120
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:40,909
I will be in a few words, presenting the reason

121
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,370
why amendments are necessary 
why amendments are done at all?

122
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:48,400
And how they fit with the rest of the preceding.

123
00:09:50,200 --> 00:10:01,780
What's their purpose and meaning. Then I will
describe the overriding and palpable errors

124
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:08,444
that the Motion Judge made
and after this I will close by

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,600
By showing why you should intervene and change the

126
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,655
decision

127
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:33,948
Now... you have an hour and a half for the two appeals...
How are you... I don't know how much time you need

128
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,700
What was the... I just want you to have at

129
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,164
least ten minutes on each, or ten minutes to reply

130
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:45,900
Yes, my original time was much more than that,
I had to scale it down

131
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,319
by a lot.

132
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,024
So how much time do you think the two

133
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,900
Presentation

134
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,800
For both of two I think I will need
the entire time I may even go over time.

135
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,045
We won't go over time. We don't go over time.

136
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,044
I may not be able to finish.

137
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,800
in the

138
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,400
in

139
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:12,195
Ok, what I would suggest to you. Okay, and you
decide what you want to do, but I was suggest to you

140
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:15,176
that as a court of appeal, we know very well

141
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,698
what is the meaning of an amendment
and the rules has to do it?

142
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,900
If I were you, I would really dig immediately
into why there's an error.

143
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:29,624
because seriously

144
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,384
You can trust us. We know the rules
about amendments. Okay?

145
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,500
That's where you'll have more time. Yes.

146
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,734
However, I would like to very very briefly talk
about the meaning. Honorable Court, in a

147
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,104
ordinary action the purpose of the amendments
to the pleadings are to set the

148
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:04,604
agenda for for the proceding, that is to inform
both the defendant and of course as to what

149
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:10,512
 the issues and questions are such that there
are no surprises to either party and such that

150
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:19,400
their the defendants rights are protected such
that they can prepare for the eventual trial

151
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:27,633
Um, according to the Federal Court Rules
amendments can be made at various stages of the

152
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:31,931
proceeding with or without leave of the Court.

153
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,396
As before the defendant even submits a reply.

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,600
An amendment can be made without even

155
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,841
Are we agreeing that in this case the statement of
Defense had been

156
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,600
Yes,

157
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:49,860
so that's a that's a reply. So that means you need
the leave of the Court,

158
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,700
correct?

159
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,618
Okay, so let's get on with

160
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,100
My point is that even after that the
statement of defense is is entered.

161
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,209
The parties can still consent.

162
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,384
No, you need leave of the Court.

163
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,847
The Court will consider

164
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,200
If there is a consent, but it's still
the court that decides

165
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:28,050
All right, wery well. I will then skip to the palpable errors.
So, on the motion for amendment, the Motion Judge

166
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:36,100
the most visible palpable error is that he considered
evidence in deciding the motion which is something that

167
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:46,500
he is not permitted to consider according with the Federal
Court Rules, and also according to the Ontario civil procedure.

168
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:57,133
Okay, why don't you turn to the rules which rules
says that he doesn't have the right to look at that and

169
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:15,062
Your Honour, based on precedent of Bauer

170
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:19,067
... that would be in my

171
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,004
Authorities

172
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:37,200
That's in 101, and which case

173
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,991
Page number 23 of the authorities book

174
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
23

175
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,900
I don't have pages and that's what I'm

176
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
it would be at the bottom of the page, bottom line.

177
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,745
Yes, but page 23 for me is a Tax Excise

178
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,600
the Excise Tax Act

179
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,300
the latest Authority book

180
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,500
Yeah.

181
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:23,279
So book of authorities 101, page 23 for me is Excise Tax

182
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,311
My friend has a book.

183
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,900
has the same book with different pages.

184
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:45,033
Okay Bauer, ok..

185
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:59,607
I don't have the same index in my as my colleague

186
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,300
So you have the same one. You don't have the Bauer?

187
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay. Okay. I don't know why

188
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm saying one may see it.

189
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,500
Yes.

190
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,700
This is one of two

191
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,300
your friend to 102

192
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,400
know. This is the book for 102.

193
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,300
But you said you were dealing with 101.

194
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm dealing with 101, but somehow the printing.

195
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,700
They must have fallen the the front pages.

196
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:37,800
The covers.

197
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,700
Okay.

198
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,200
No problem.

199
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,300
You're referring to the decision.

200
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,600
Which paragraph

201
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,500
paragraph 16?

202
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,300
Stinky. Yes.

203
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,292
When determining whether amendment should be allowed

204
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:07,359
to the judge [unintelligible] matter to ask
whether the amendment would be

205
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,800
capable of being struck

206
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:15,700
the test for being struck in the Fiddle Court Rules.

207
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,300
in 2121

208
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,000
But there are several paragraphs.

209
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:33,400
And only the paragraph no reasonable cause of action. You don't look at evidence all the other paragraph you look at it.

210
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:41,700
Yes

211
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,700
generous, correct.

212
00:17:45,700 --> 00:18:02,800
So if the church things that there's no chance of success or taxation or and that's the another paragraph that you want one where is entitled to look at it?

213
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:18,200
Yes. However in those in this case those were not considered for those other points the church didn't look what was immaterial or redundant material. He didn't look at whether there was candles. He was no language like that in his decision.

214
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,400
Oh, okay. Let's look at the decision.

215
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:38,300
is order

216
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,200
Yes, power

217
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
power antenna.

218
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes, so that's the same case you refer to

219
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
yes.

220
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,700
And the proposed extending that came to not demonstrate their reasonable chance of success.

221
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
I guess you're under the test for

222
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,600
for emotions to amend is

223
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:08,900
I was

224
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I think most authoritatively rested by the federal court by the Supreme Court and Imperial tobacco.

225
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,100
Yes,

226
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,600
which is records by these other cases.

227
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,400
Yes.

228
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800
very little case is that

229
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,200
page

230
00:19:50,700 --> 00:20:03,600
So yeah, but that was also that 22 a 2.18 it was the there was no reasonable cause of action so there he don't look at evidence.

231
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
well, perhaps it would then be

232
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:23,300
helpful for me to look at why MMS are necessary what their life cycle is why why and when evidence should not considered in a case that emotion to amend would be

233
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:33,600
Dismissed that is the client will be blocked from being heard. The plaintiff can always submit.

234
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,200
That many men as a new option.

235
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:52,100
As a new statement of Clans to pursue the same dispute because just by blocking the amendment does not result. It is just so the plaintiff would then

236
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,600
get it as a new action.

237
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,500
based on the same material thoughts

238
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,300
It's always because

239
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,900
you say if he doesn't allow the amendments.

240
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,300
Their claim as it was is still before the court. Is that what you

241
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,800
said is, correct?

242
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Okay. So the same before the court is still and that brings us to the second appeal.

243
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,700
Because you see these things are very much linked.

244
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:26,700
Yeah.

245
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,900
But the Amendments the proposed amendments are are left in the air. They're not

246
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,100
having discarded.

247
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:59,200
Allow them you're saying that they still exist in that there's still a cause of action.

248
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,700
That's available to you.

249
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,400
There's something adding to something that goes over there.

250
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,700
Well, you are one of the Amendments doesn't produce any costs about

251
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,500
which one

252
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,800
that is the one that

253
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
All right proposed on them.

254
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,200
You're adding two defendants.

255
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,400
I might put a defenders in their capacity as a crowned as agents of the crown.

256
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:49,200
Okay, 25 just by I'm looking now at the age of 48 Bill booking.

257
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,500
That is Amanda the underlying

258
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,100
yes,

259
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,600
which one has the new cause of action?

260
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,900
The claim is that the CBSA circulates under 16(c).
The CBSA circulates an internal operations bulletin.

261
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,045
and

262
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,509
61

263
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,022
so that's 60

264
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,000
16(c) is on page 60

265
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
page. Yes, 16(c) is on page 161

266
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
I have a home page

267
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,900
60.

268
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,308
Is that the CBSA circulates an
internal operational bulletin?

269
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,449
For me, it's page 60.

270
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,754
So I don't know why but okay.
So that's the important thing.

271
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:19,067
We have the right paragraph.
So you're saying this is a new cause an action

272
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,558
It's a new cause of action, it alleges that the

273
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:25,876
CBSA is involved in money laundering

274
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,092
but that's not it's just

275
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:35,700
Isn't it just a remedy? Because you've already
said that you thought that you was

276
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,200
enabling

277
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,565
I had not mentioned money laundering.
Money laundering is a new cause of action

278
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:53,780
 in the Amendments. Before then, in the
original Statement of Claim

279
00:24:55,017 --> 00:24:57,800
I had suspected that it was something that's

280
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,100
good. So what else is a new cause

281
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,600
and there's a lot

282
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,300
of underlining.

283
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,100
Yes, but most of this is really.

284
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:23,500
All related you see you cannot come to 16 and plain unless you've had allegation in the first part.

285
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,600
So there are allegations that are linked to these.

286
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Because you see like that these this is not a new cause of action. It's just

287
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:46,600
you're making education of fat that would bring you into whatever remedy you're asking.

288
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,200
Well, if I find religion that CBS is a criminal organization.

289
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:01,700
Okay, let's not lose too much time on this. Okay. So here saying let's say 17 a is a new plane because it's finished.

290
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,500
There before that was there before.

291
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:24,600
So that this new apart from that because you didn't ask for 2004 we did ask for 15,000.

292
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,900
I'm just not seeing.

293
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,300
New cause of action that would stand on their own.

294
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,800
the honor this

295
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,400
without finding specifically the paragraph because they're so many that I had touched the allegation of

296
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,400
money laundering and criminal organization are new.

297
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,700
Okay, and what what's the point of this do you were saying that these would stand on their own in another proceedings?

298
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,900
They can be pursued on their own. So

299
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,200
now there's not Time bar.

300
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:12,500
You have the time limitation issue. You cannot take an action, you know 20 years from the date of the events and say I have this

301
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,900
is correct. But at the time that they maybe was proposed.

302
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,600
I had only just learned about the money laundering.

303
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Okay, you can always what you're saying is that you can

304
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,400
take a separate action. Is that what you're

305
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
saying? Well, yes.

306
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,900
Okay. So why don't you that's what you say

307
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,800
because that would not be the most vicious and and this cost way to reach Justice.

308
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,700
Okay, that's your argument for why you made an error?

309
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,900
Because we have to make sense of this.

310
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,300
Well, you are my argument is that he used evidence where shouldn't have?

311
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,900
the court

312
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,400
I'm sorry. My presentation is

313
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,700
no I'm just trying to make sure that I don't want to miss what you're saying.

314
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,400
You started with that. Okay that you should not have look at that. I thought

315
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,800
well, you said that he may not look at evidence on

316
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:31,400
2.181 a but it can't accept there's a they are exception under eight for to addiction. For example.

317
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Well, they're not stated in their rules. You're on.

318
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Yeah, but they're stated in the case of

319
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,500
that's very cute in their role. It doesn't say anything that the rule is being construed by case law.

320
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,200
and

321
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,200
if I'm not mistaken, it's fun for

322
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
That but anyway, I

323
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,300
am

324
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,900
operating we continue

325
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,100
operating under the guidance of the Supreme Court.

326
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,100
Says very clearly and without doubt.

327
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,500
All

328
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,900
okay. Let's let's

329
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,200
continue

330
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:46,300
and 23

331
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:05,500
What is impossible to enumerate all the factors that a judge must take into participation determining whether an adjustment?

332
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:21,400
Where is it whether it is just a given case to authorizing Amendment. The general rules is that an amendment should be allowed at any state or the action for the purpose of determining their real questions and controversy between the department provided notably that the allowance will not result in an injustice.

333
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,800
For the other party and not capable of being compensated by an award of costs.

334
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,500
That's good. That's good. As I told you don't lose too much time on the law. We can read it

335
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:38,500
in case you're under that is oh I have for

336
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,600
this presentation

337
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,900
that's that's

338
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,500
wrong in using evidence

339
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,700
and that would be an airplane.

340
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,900
specifically

341
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:08,000
Or it might be an error in his that is a reasons are not clear enough as to which paragraph he was looking at.

342
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:21,400
Well the owner in a few words I can demonstrate why looking at sectional 106 which is what the defendant proposed is flawed to look at that point. And that's for

343
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,000
the amendment.

344
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,600
No, one of the Customs out.

345
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,900
Yes, but we're now looking at are you

346
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:36,500
on the amendment? I'm only doing with the members so far. I'm understanding that. We're addressing these two cases separately.

347
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,900
No, but what your hour and a half is for the two of them?

348
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,700
It's three hours for both.

349
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,600
Yes. We are only dealing with

350
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,000
so what

351
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,200
do you want to say about so

352
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:59,700
many six the pendant proposed officers wear?

353
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,600
Would not be liable.

354
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,600
For their actions under the custom job.

355
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,100
Yes.

356
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:15,200
Nobody do not be liable. Not under the customer's of

357
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,000
Activities.

358
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,700
Yes

359
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,000
under the Customs act and yes, they are nothing for someone

360
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,100
okay, if they are not in pursuant.

361
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,500
The Crown cannot be the vicariously liable.

362
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:35,000
You cannot sue the Crown for something done outside of their duties. You can sue them, but you cannot sue the Crown.

363
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,700
Well the crown

364
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:42,200
either they are inside their Duty and the crown because of the employer are liable for them.

365
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,600
Okay, they cherish me or they're not doing it on their Duty then they are responsible for it.

366
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,600
Well, they're not doing it in their personal capacity.

367
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:11,100
What if they're doing a frog that's what you're saying? They're doing a fraud. It's and it's outside of the customer. You're trying to get out of Windows 6 to get out of Windows 6. You have to get out of the crust on that and you have to get out of the vicarious liability of the front.

368
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,800
You know, the word is

369
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,300
not really

370
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:24,200
cares means you are responsible for your agents and employees for what he did in the performance of their Duty.

371
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:25,900
See what

372
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,100
and

373
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,400
so you could sue them personally.

374
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,400
And that may not come under one was six if it is outside of their Duty.

375
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:45,000
But that's not be within the jurisdiction of our core because we only can entertain that kind of action against the crown itself,

376
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,500
correct?

377
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,900
The other person assuming that the thought is true.

378
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,700
Assuming that the fact is traded

379
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,100
are true.

380
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,700
Fraud would have to be one of the tools that these officers are allowed to employ to implement the custom job.

381
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,600
They have a number of activities that they can employers actually searches questioning.

382
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,900
Okay, and

383
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,000
that's why the section 106
does not protect them from

384
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,600
and how do you

385
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:26,000
Why do you think that the Crown can be liable
for something that is not within their duty?

386
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,000
It's not within their duty of anything to do fraud

387
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:49,277
They were doing the fraud, they were justifying
it as implementing the Customs Act

388
00:34:49,229 --> 00:34:55,214
so their cover was their duty

389
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,102
If we had met on the street and they asked me for
my coins, I would not have given it to them as

390
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,000
as a person, as an individual.
I only gave him my coins because they were

391
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,100
Do you have any case though

392
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:20,376
that you can sue them

393
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,200
And there is case of fraud and it
would not apply to the Crown

394
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:29,946
the one authority I can point to

395
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,600
is my book of authorities for 102

396
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,889
authority for 102 and I am referring to...

397
00:35:55,028 --> 00:36:00,182
Zolotow v. Canada, page 46

398
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:09,542
page 46 ... [unintelligible]

399
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:13,273
Paragraph

400
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:17,385
the case that I have

401
00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:21,194
Now for 46 I have

402
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:25,979
[unintelligible]

403
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:30,278
yes, I've gone to the

404
00:36:30,974 --> 00:36:34,219
That's the one that used to be 101 but became 102

405
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:36,344
[unintelligible]

406
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:41,327
It's Zolotow

407
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,731
Zolotow

408
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:46,471
just a second.

409
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,276
I don't have a 46 in the other one so it has to be this one

410
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,600
Yes, it is one of the longer table.

411
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,887
Yes and my page 46.

412
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,518
Oh, is it because you didn't?

413
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,300
Did you just put pages without the
front and just a page out of the text?

414
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,420
Yes.

415
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:16,354
ok

416
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:21,359
so the point you're making about that case
though just to bring us back to the

417
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:30,081
The point is that under paragraph 30 if illegal
acts are really done from the motive other than an

418
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:34,554
honest drive to execute a statutory or legal duty

419
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:42,934
Then, the Public Authorities Act is no
defense for the acts complained of

420
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,391
of are not done in the intended execution of a
statute, but only in the pretended execution

421
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:52,482
thereof.

422
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:55,151
So that's why you're saying
the Customs Act does not apply

423
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:59,909
because you're alleging that the officers
were committing a fraud

424
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:07,109
Fraud would not be one of the tools that
they can employ they were however using

425
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:13,473
pretending to act as Customs officers pretending
 that these coins where goods so that they

426
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:16,714
 could seize them and request their

427
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:19,308
I understand your point very well.

428
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:25,255
Where I'm concerned is how you can sue the Crown
for something that's outside of their duties.

429
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,700
Uh, and that's the Crown Liabilities Act

430
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:31,734
Do you have...

431
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:36,650
just a second have you put Council
the Crown Liability section?

432
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:38,725
No

433
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:43,533
I have the Crown Liability

434
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,771
under the authorities 101, page 11

435
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,019
at page 12

436
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:05,258
Liability and Civil Salvage

437
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:12,800
The Crown is liable for the damage for which,
if it were a person, it would be liable.

438
00:39:13,903 --> 00:39:19,300
any other province in respect of a tort
committed by a servant of the Crown

439
00:39:19,848 --> 00:39:23,990
the fault... I don't know if it's fraud

440
00:39:24,418 --> 00:39:26,418
Fraud is a tort, is it not?

441
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,180
That's what I'm saying to you,
we'll need to look at that

442
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,321
If they're acting outside of their duties totally

443
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,900
Normally an employer would not be responsible
 so we have to look at case law

444
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,900
just saying don't have it before you
before us we'll have to look at

445
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,141
Good. So what we'll do is to make sure that you have

446
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,654
we don't want to construe 3(1)

447
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Okay, 3(a)(i) without you being able
to make submissions on it

448
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,276
So I would give you

449
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:36,675
Or Thursday with the end of the day next Monday

450
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,339
Be a good you can write to the Court and say
here are some authorities that I would like

451
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:48,056
 to submit to show that a fraud
would come within 3(a)(i)

452
00:40:48,056 --> 00:40:49,400
by Monday?

453
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,368
Yes, the end of the day on Monday, that okay?

454
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:55,927
I'm not able to I am out of the my home country for a week.

455
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,186
I live in Mexico for much
of the time I came here specially

456
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,602
Um, can I have two weeks?

457
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:12,257
Yes it just that we won't be so long as
 the case is not closed. We cannot render

458
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:15,029
a decision. If I give you two weeks.

459
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:20,137
I'm just saying I don't know when you'll
get your decision because we sit everywhere.

460
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,600
and the time to write your case
might be next week, so

461
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:30,252
well, in any case I have I have no way of
sitting down and looking at this until 

462
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,093
at the very least Wednesday

463
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,292
the earliest that I'll be back home is Wednesday

464
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,681
Okay, so, okay. You'll have to wait.

465
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,960
that means, see the calendar

466
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:12,829
That's June 7, is that ok for you?

467
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:15,565
And you understand what we're looking for.

468
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,139
Um, my understanding is that you are
looking for representations as to why

469
00:42:20,252 --> 00:42:22,262
the Crown would be

470
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:26,181
and just to be sure

471
00:42:26,155 --> 00:42:32,376
My coleague pointed out. We're looking at 3(b)(i)

472
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,600
because it's not the province of Quebec.

473
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:42,529
The other province, okay, so 3(b)(i)

474
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:45,800
so why 3(b)(i) applies

475
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,902
in the case of would apply to make
the Crown viable for fraud

476
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,097
for fraud commited outside of their duty

477
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,700
Are we making the assumption that if they
were working on the clock and working on?

478
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:07,659
and working on the seizure

479
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,100
that they are outside of their duty?

480
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:17,600
that's what you are supposed to
I'm giving you a chance to argue this point.

481
00:43:18,186 --> 00:43:20,993
provide some authority

482
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:22,021
I will

483
00:43:23,385 --> 00:43:28,364
Thank you.
At this stage, we're not making any assumptions

484
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,454
that is all I have for A-101

485
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,500
for representations, I would like to move on to 102

486
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,082
So, 102

487
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,294
and obviously

488
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,345
the other side will have the right to respond

489
00:44:25,923 --> 00:44:28,654
I'll see what they need in terms of time,

490
00:44:28,746 --> 00:44:32,771
but it's something that we normally know
well, so we should be

491
00:44:32,852 --> 00:44:35,227
quite good with the case

492
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:41,014
Your Honour without further ado
I'd like to get into 102

493
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,480
there are numerous palpable errors

494
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:48,736
to discuss the first one

495
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,745
the judge was required to find whether

496
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,833
section 102

497
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,304
let me these backtrack and explain

498
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,900
and explain the larger picture

499
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:09,389
in the 102 and the

500
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:13,606
motion for summary judgment

501
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,994
the defendant made representations

502
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,374
to guide the way the case was considered. He

503
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,684
conflated

504
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,300
an appeal under section

505
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,500
132... 135

506
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,300
135 with the purpose of the entire action

507
00:45:35,481 --> 00:45:39,776
He represented that

508
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,814
Wherever a section 135 claim appears,

509
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:53,276
The preceding is a special type of proceeding that
is  outside of those defined under the

510
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,340
Federal Court Rules.

511
00:45:55,347 --> 00:46:01,219
He said that it is not neither an
application for review, neither

512
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,800
An ordinary action, neither a simplified action, neither a class action.

513
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:14,339
He alleges that an appeal is just a different type
of proceeding where the Cout is being asked

514
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:17,489
to reconsider

515
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,602
anew the decision that was before
the Minister. He represents that

516
00:46:24,124 --> 00:46:29,597
the task before the judge was to decide

517
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,233
in the Minister's place, based on new evidence

518
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:39,100
whether there was a contravention or not

519
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,300
Guiding the preceeding this way can only lead to

520
00:46:48,332 --> 00:46:52,795
an outcome in his favor

521
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,259
and it is incorrect the... an appeal

522
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:05,286
Under 135 is simply one claim.

523
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,784
that can be entered as part of the

524
00:47:10,248 --> 00:47:13,660
ordiary action. The preceding type

525
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:19,600
that you're allowed to make a 135
claim under is an ordinary action

526
00:47:21,377 --> 00:47:27,649
and the appeal is only one of the claims available

527
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:34,772
However, there is nothing in the Customs Act
that precludes a plaintiff from

528
00:47:38,486 --> 00:47:45,150
from joining other claims that arise from
the same facts, from the same details.

529
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:53,051
Do you agree because the judge
rely on two cases, okay

530
00:47:54,218 --> 00:47:56,218
Starway and...

531
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:06,096
I'm trying to find the decision

532
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:19,193
Starway and Nguyen?

533
00:48:19,177 --> 00:48:20,846
yes

534
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,452
now, these two cases deal with

535
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,826
an action or a negations

536
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,400
contensting the amount of penalty.

537
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,900
Do you contest the amount of
penalty in your action?

538
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:42,864
No,

539
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:49,500
okay. So do you agree that if we follow
these cases because in the Customs Act

540
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,019
it is clear that to

541
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,400
challenge a decision on the penalty

542
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,321
you have to go to a judicial.

543
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,182
I do not.

544
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,900
the penalty

545
00:49:01,174 --> 00:49:02,374
Yes, I do not.

546
00:49:02,762 --> 00:49:04,000
So you contest that

547
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,165
Yes.

548
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:07,287
Okay, even though you're not joining

549
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:08,410
Correct.

550
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,914
So

551
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,674
Your Honour, let me address this
point exactly, specifically

552
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,104
you have that at page 18 of your

553
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,539
authorities

554
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,558
I believe Starway was

555
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,896
In Starway, there were two issues.

556
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:21,793
There was both whether the issue that there
was an infraction, and also the issue of whether

557
00:50:21,793 --> 00:50:27,049
the minister could keep the money

558
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,509
He, the judge specifically looked.

559
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,962
And explained that it makes no
sense to allow the defendant to keep

560
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,200
the terms of release if the decision cannot stand.

561
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,875
I'm sorry.
The one that you've included

562
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:54,109
If one intends to dispute the amount of penalty,
one must apply for judicial review

563
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:00,571
Before it has been determined that the case
committed. This is an anomaly. Okay.

564
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,000
and everybody has said it's an anomaly but

565
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:13,725
Well, it may be an anomaly. I am referring to
Starway at my authority page 44 and 45.

566
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,100
Specifically paragraphs 27 and 28

567
00:51:20,101 --> 00:51:21,158
Okay

568
00:51:21,182 --> 00:51:24,071
Starway

569
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:31,162
27 and 28 of Starway

570
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:36,219
Ok, again I don't have the right...

571
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,205
page 48?

572
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:41,661
44 and 45

573
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:47,999
 47 and thank you

574
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:54,550
At paragraph 27... in accordance with section 135
of the Act, this is an ordinary action. The only

575
00:51:54,622 --> 00:52:01,352
special rule imposed was that whether Mr. Starway
made an untrue statement

576
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:08,000
I will deal with this a little later.
The amount of penalty is not an issue.

577
00:52:08,018 --> 00:52:11,750
This is a trial, not paper review.

578
00:52:14,262 --> 00:52:21,144
Yes, and where does he say that
you can dispute the penalty in an action?

579
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:26,631
the next paragraph, paragraph 28 begins with
"The next issue the imposition of the penalty,

580
00:52:26,597 --> 00:52:29,663
not the amount thereof".

581
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,481
"The defendants submit that at
best I can only declare..." and so on and so on.

582
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,422
At the end of the paragraph 28 Starways says
"Since there was no infraction of the Customs Act,

583
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,717
 it follows that defendants cannot
keep the amount forfeited"

584
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Yeah, but that's a different question. I was
talking to you about the amount of the penalty

585
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,900
I know that in your action, you do discuss
that the amount was reduced by the minister.

586
00:52:57,677 --> 00:53:01,891
three hundred instead of the other amount

587
00:53:03,796 --> 00:53:06,697
let's discus the remedies

588
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:13,234
once there is no contravention, what can you do?
Obviously, there's no contravention.

589
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:15,995
There's no contravention!

590
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:22,707
The defendant states that the only available
remedy for the Court is to declare whether

591
00:53:22,668 --> 00:53:26,104
or not there was a contravention

592
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,500
He specifically says

593
00:53:31,992 --> 00:53:36,844
So you're trying to say under 135, what are the remedies?

594
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,300
But what we're looking at now is whether you can

595
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:45,576
you can can use the vehicle of application

596
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,200
Or an ordinary action to contest
the amount of the penalty.

597
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,000
Well, they are

598
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,100
but there's an issue

599
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,400
it is a claim

600
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,790
I would like to point out ACL.

601
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:10,500
I'm not I have to say I'm not 100% I
just want to make sure we get your point on this.

602
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,700
I would like to point out to ACL
as another example where

603
00:54:14,779 --> 00:54:18,938
ACL Canada

604
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:25,779
bringing it back to your particular case

605
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:28,254
what exactly are you saying

606
00:54:28,445 --> 00:54:31,587
I'm saying that just because

607
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,800
a claim under Section 135 is contained
within an ordinary action,

608
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,067
There is no provision in the Customs Act to make
it the exclusive claim that can be

609
00:54:41,006 --> 00:54:43,284
made in that ordinary action,

610
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:50,867
The Customs Act itself does not limit, does not say
that you may not have another claim that is

611
00:54:51,015 --> 00:54:53,030
related to the same facts

612
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,665
That's clear. And what's not clear is

613
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:00,000
if it is clear in Customs Act

614
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:06,291
certain issues need to be dealt
with by judicial review

615
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,550
certain decision under the Customs Act needs to be

616
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:15,834
contested by way of judicial

617
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:20,046
That's that's the problem I'm trying to eliminate

618
00:55:19,977 --> 00:55:22,945
Is there anything in your claim

619
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:28,519
That would be comparable to the claims that
were made in the two cases on which

620
00:55:28,654 --> 00:55:31,948
the judge relies.

621
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,553
Which is just Starway and Nguyen

622
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:43,330
 Yes, there are multiple claims in the same action

623
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,300
Is there any of those claims in your action?

624
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,946
That are the same as the claims that were
dealt with in Starway and Nguyen

625
00:55:51,894 --> 00:55:55,330
Well, they're not the same claims.

626
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:03,821
I think that's the point that you you want to make.

627
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:09,132
It's not what is dealt with in those cases
was something that needed to be

628
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:12,027
done by application, not by action

629
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:23,362
 if I were to address this issue of application vs
action, the Customs Act does not even require

630
00:56:23,476 --> 00:56:27,337
the amount of to be disputed by way of application

631
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,832
Yes, but that's

632
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,677
that's what it's supposed to be.

633
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,678
This decision have to be about federal office.

634
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,537
contested by way of judicial review

635
00:56:42,187 --> 00:56:47,417
if you're seeking damages, there
can be a conversion

636
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,708
But all this must be done, you know, there can be a
conversion if you want to get damages

637
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,400
from that decision.

638
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,100
And this is why I was pointing to ACL kind of so,

639
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:02,217
At ACL, which paragraph

640
00:57:02,175 --> 00:57:06,393
At page 42 of your book of authority

641
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
page 42

642
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:20,270
in ACL the judge looked at section 135 claim
and concluded at paragraph 61

643
00:57:20,275 --> 00:57:26,710
third line from the bottom, that

644
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:33,400
under the section 135 the plaintiff's action
in this regard must be dismissed.

645
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,900
within that regard

646
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,200
which Regard

647
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,300
in regard to section 135

648
00:57:44,563 --> 00:57:53,155
[reads ACL Canada para 61]

649
00:57:54,408 --> 00:57:58,957
[reads ACL Canada para 61]

650
00:57:59,192 --> 00:58:09,287
[reads ACL Canada para 61]

651
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,975
Okay, so

652
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,500
why is that of interest to us? It seems to confirm with the judge was saying

653
00:58:16,982 --> 00:58:19,237
so under 135.

654
00:58:19,693 --> 00:58:24,306
That specific claim can be dismissed.
However, he went on to consider the claim under

655
00:58:24,422 --> 00:58:29,540
133 in the following paragraph, paragraph 6...

656
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:32,653
Actually the second following paragraph, 63

657
00:58:32,706 --> 00:58:40,658
[reads ACL Canada para 62]

658
00:58:48,952 --> 00:58:51,173
and 63

659
00:58:53,400 --> 00:59:00,727
[continues reading ACL Canada para 62]

660
00:59:02,755 --> 00:59:06,557
So he seems to be saying the
contrary to what you're saying

661
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:12,521
He's saying that section 135 does
not give the minister

662
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:20,200
That's right. And he says either 135 or otherwise under the act or the general jurisdiction of the Court.

663
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,700
which which means that if if

664
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,959
if relief sought was within the general
jurisdiction of the Court, he would he would

665
00:59:31,038 --> 00:59:34,305
 have to consider it.

666
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:41,940
He did not consider that relief only
because he was concerning section 133

667
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:46,266
but you were relying on a passage.

668
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:53,983
where you said the judge confirmed that
the Court could give could make an order

669
00:59:54,151 --> 00:59:59,379
for that. There's no money for [unintelligible]
 That was the previous case that you called.

670
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:05,462
And now they're saying we don't have that
jurisdiction. So these two cases...

671
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:10,281
 will have to go and look at okay, because
they seem to be contradictory

672
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:20,022
he also replies that if another remedy within the

673
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:27,100
Action was within the general jurisdiction of
the Court, he would have to consider it

674
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:33,008
Yes. He says it's not within the jurisdiction
to say no forfeiture, that's contrary

675
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,633
 to what you just said before

676
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,844
that's specific claim you are right,

677
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,727
you know, what we'll read them because

678
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,100
I found

679
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:49,100
To summarize, you're saying that
we should be distinguishing

680
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,250
Starway and Nguyen

681
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,517
You know, no I'm not let me just finish my thought

682
01:00:55,620 --> 01:01:00,127
your I think saying that the judge was wrong and in

683
01:01:00,049 --> 01:01:03,786
using those two cases to rely on,
because you're saying

684
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,100
because of your case is definately can be
distinguished and you're relying on ACL

685
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:10,852
to say that the court has

686
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,600
more jurisdiction to deal with these matters. Is that is that what it is

687
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:21,007
it is, however in

688
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:28,156
yes, so we based on ACL the Court does
have more jurisdiction to consider

689
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,200
your claims

690
01:01:29,434 --> 01:01:32,945
section 133 which is an additional claims

691
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,600
so I want to make sure I understand your points. Okay?

692
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:44,336
Starway for a second... in Starway, page 45

693
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:47,198
continue our reading Starway
after we talked about

694
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:52,395
he pointed out the fact that he says he
can't keep the money that there's no infraction

695
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,400
kind of playing on [unintelligible] ...
dollars should be returned

696
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:01,840
Now, so this is over the comments of the judge

697
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:06,732
did he actually order the money thing returned?
Do you you actually have the judgments

698
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,846
That will go on and even though they may not
have jurisdiction to deal with something just

699
01:02:11,943 --> 01:02:15,241
just point out that ... crap, as long as I make a
decision, I should do something

700
01:02:15,323 --> 01:02:17,944
even though I may not be able to
order you do something

701
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,917
I don't know if there was an order or

702
01:02:24,538 --> 01:02:28,670
it was just his comment that this seems to be logical thing

703
01:02:28,687 --> 01:02:30,510
thing you really should do.

704
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:34,857
So we'll look at that. We'll find the judgement

705
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:41,372
Because otherwise these two cases
would be contradictory

706
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:49,067
I would like to also a point out
in paragraph 63 of ACL

707
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,244
the judge did

708
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:59,381
towards the end, he ends with "I conclude that an
order should go setting aside the Minister's 

709
01:02:59,415 --> 01:03:03,099
determination made under section 133 and 
referring both matters back

710
01:03:03,165 --> 01:03:06,844
 for reconsideration by another adjudicator"

711
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:12,034
So that means that even in an ordinary action,

712
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,655
Section 133 was good,

713
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:20,155
you know what would read the case because
 that's why normally you shouldn't have

714
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:24,649
 a page like this. We don't have to have
 the whole case here have it all.

715
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:29,938
but we'll look at. So that's your first

716
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,800
What else do you want to say about 102?

717
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,820
about joinder

718
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,929
It's again.

719
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:53,551
joinder under 106 of the Rules

720
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,200
Well, there's no claim under 106

721
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,893
I'm not talking of the Customs Act,
I'm talking about the Rules.

722
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,924
Yes, that will be Rule 101

723
01:04:07,422 --> 01:04:10,519
of the Federal Court Rules

724
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,264
Rule 101 paragraph 1

725
01:04:18,962 --> 01:04:25,086
"Subject to rule 302, a party to a proceeding may
request relief against another party to the

726
01:04:25,143 --> 01:04:28,846
 same proceeding in respect of more than one claim"

727
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:38,600
So it would be incorrect. So it was a palpable
 and overriding erorr for the Motion Judge

728
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:46,217
To disallow this Rule and claim that only a section
135 claim can be made in an ordinary action.

729
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,886
when the Rules of the Federal Court
obviously say otherwise

730
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:59,931
anything else

731
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,552
Yes.

732
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,316
You're going very well.

733
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,600
Your Honour,

734
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,600
I'd like to point out Rule 106 of the
Federal Court Rules

735
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,746
complication or delay or would prejudice a
party, the Court may order separate claims

736
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,300
Or many orders that came to be split or to
be dealt with in a more convenient fashion.

737
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,200
So with your saying is he should have split it.

738
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,800
If you thought that this was
completed as a dismissal,

739
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,400
that's right.

740
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:53,900
Okay.

741
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:05,200
Because just ignoring and dismissing claims
without looking at them.There's no justice in it

742
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,000
it's not in the interest of justice

743
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,400
okay.

744
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,929
I'd like to point out.

745
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,410
the Excise Tax Act

746
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,508
but this goes again to multiple

747
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,300
preceding

748
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:27,500
proceedings to multiple claims in the same proceeding

749
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:27,900
Yeah

750
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,272
section...

751
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:34,216
the Excise Tax Act

752
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:42,300
I don't have my I wouldn't need a few seconds
to find the section that I'm talking about

753
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,964
Take your few seconds

754
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,000
It's in your book of authorities?

755
01:06:52,271 --> 01:07:00,869
You have have just 15... page 15, to

756
01:07:00,894 --> 01:07:07,661
25, but I think 25 is the definition of
money, because you're on 15

757
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,748
I may have messed up...
are you looking for 81.28?

758
01:07:40,129 --> 01:07:42,856
on page 18

759
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:51,395
yes... 81.29 was in my notes

760
01:08:02,158 --> 01:08:06,582
Is your point that the
rule concerning joinder apply?

761
01:08:06,574 --> 01:08:12,394
to these actions, that's 81.28(3)

762
01:08:12,377 --> 01:08:18,948
my case... doesn't seem to be..

763
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,167
I am a little...

764
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,899
You know what? What we'll do, because
you're almost at the end of your time...

765
01:08:30,936 --> 01:08:34,877
We'll break for 5 minutes

766
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:40,277
You collect your thoughts, and you
pick the things you've not yet said

767
01:08:40,347 --> 01:08:44,490
That would be fantastic, thank you

768
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,091
order

769
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:00,168
order!

770
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:07,559
Court is resumed

771
01:09:09,314 --> 01:09:11,314
Thank you for the extra time

772
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:19,035
I'd like to continue. With respect to joinder,

773
01:09:20,183 --> 01:09:26,837
The Excise Tax Act s.81.28(3)(a)

774
01:09:28,169 --> 01:09:35,107
Gives us an example how if
Parliament intended to limits

775
01:09:35,556 --> 01:09:40,707
the claims available in an ordinary action,
they can, with specific language.

776
01:09:40,828 --> 01:09:45,836
In the Excise Tax Act, they basically
exclude the rules by saying

777
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:49,253
 "the rules concerning joinder of
parties and causes of action..."

778
01:09:49,277 --> 01:09:53,048
do not apply except for the joinder
of appeals under that Part"

779
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,703
Which means

780
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:00,997
Which means that under the Customs Act,
since no such limitation is given,

781
01:10:01,178 --> 01:10:06,988
 it cannot be implied.
The Parliament does have the ability to

782
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:14,078
I like to move on to the next point the
next clear error; the Motion Judge ignored

783
01:10:14,157 --> 01:10:17,952
ignored the plaintiff's evidence
on several occasions.

784
01:10:18,035 --> 01:10:23,623
 The first one would have been
the Currency Act section 11.

785
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,257
Which is at authorities book page

786
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:39,529
That's where you wanted to say
that the statute is evidence.

787
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:45,085
The Currency Act is not evidence, it's the law.

788
01:10:45,061 --> 01:10:50,637
You say that he ignored the
relevant section of the law

789
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,088
It is evidence my... understanding of the Act is that

790
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,800
The Acts that I bring, that I present
to the court, with my case,

791
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,700
are part of my evidence but

792
01:11:00,876 --> 01:11:07,602
statutes are another their statutes.
So don't worry. It means that it

793
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:10,604
might be an error... still an error.

794
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,259
not to consider

795
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,063
relevant section

796
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:20,183
so you're saying why is it relevant and

797
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,866
it is relevant because specifically

798
01:11:26,069 --> 01:11:29,948
That's on page 27?

799
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:35,877
11..

800
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:44,874
That's 29... No person shall, except in
accordance with a license granted by the

801
01:11:44,917 --> 01:11:49,085
minister, melt down, break down or
use otherwise than as currency

802
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,140
any coin that is current and legal tender in Canada

803
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,500
I would underline "to use otherwise, then as currency"

804
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:02,168
What do you want to do with that?

805
01:12:02,947 --> 01:12:08,684
It is relevant because the Currency Act itself
tells that currency cannot be treated as "goods".

806
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:15,930
It cannot be used as goods or something else.
It's only a token of currency.

807
01:12:17,606 --> 01:12:22,281
so you're saying you should
have discussed your argument

808
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,300
The coins you had in this case
are the US coins, right?

809
01:12:29,915 --> 01:12:31,777
Are they legal tender in Canada?

810
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,500
They're not legal tender in Canada.

811
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,700
How does 11(1) apply?

812
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,721
there's a parallel was drawn and
it was not contested by other party that

813
01:12:41,817 --> 01:12:45,696
 coins of the United States, the treatment
of the United States and in Canada

814
01:12:45,922 --> 01:12:52,346
are parallel and equivalent legislations
and the rules that would apply to coins in

815
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,700
corresponding coins in Canada

816
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,700
also applying to currency of the United States

817
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:06,822
tell us which Act? People cannot
agree on the law without...

818
01:13:09,724 --> 01:13:16,574
Canada has similar coins as the ones I had
which are $50 gold coins and five one dollar coins?

819
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:25,039
So the point is that if the Canadian coins cannot
 can be not not treated cannot be treated

820
01:13:24,997 --> 01:13:30,512
as goods or as something other than currency,
then the US coins cannot either.

821
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,200
On what basis you say that?

822
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:41,468
Your Honor the the United States public law
that is the that is the corresponding law of the

823
01:13:41,509 --> 01:13:46,000
Canadian one, the Currency Act,
states this. It has the same

824
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:48,992
Yes, but the US act only applies in the US.

825
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,785
And the Canadian act applies in Canada.

826
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:56,101
so I'm not understanding why the fact that

827
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:02,100
If you US coins are not currency
in Canada, a legal tender

828
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:07,600
they are currency in the United States.

829
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,784
Yes, but we're in Canada now

830
01:14:11,476 --> 01:14:13,208
If they were Canadian coins,

831
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:18,795
they could also not be considered "goods"
for the reasons of section 11

832
01:14:20,633 --> 01:14:27,421
They are not Canadian Coins.
The question of my colleague is "Why would this act

833
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
apply to US

834
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,146
because it shows that Canadian coins are treated

835
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,891
in a specific way

836
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:38,600
Yes,

837
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,000
and it was never any contention any

838
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,170
it's an anology you're making, because
this section cannot apply directly

839
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,500
The defendant agreed that coins of the

840
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,400
we don't care that he agrees or not.

841
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,100
If it's a matter of law we need to
know what's your position

842
01:14:55,100 --> 01:15:01,035
well in that case. I would have to present the
equivalent section from the United States Act

843
01:15:04,904 --> 01:15:08,824
The US coins are not tender in Can

844
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,996
Okay. So what you're saying is paragraph?

845
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,912
section 11

846
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,100
would apply if they were coins in Canadian currency

847
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:25,115
you say by analogy,

848
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:32,200
we should treat the US the same way because
the US act as absolutely no application here,

849
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,300
correct.

850
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:37,688
Okay, so it's by analogy.

851
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:51,035
Next one. I like to point out that.

852
01:15:53,289 --> 01:16:00,288
the motion judge errored in accepting the
defendant's explanation that

853
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,200
the Customs Act applies to all Goods

854
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,829
which is not true, they

855
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,887
the Customs Act is activated specifically
 by the Excise Tax Act.

856
01:16:13,095 --> 01:16:18,246
 It doesn't just come into force out of the blue for
everything that you bring into Canada.

857
01:16:18,832 --> 01:16:22,832
 For instance. If you import food or water

858
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:25,949
 or even my own vehicle that I was driving that day

859
01:16:26,037 --> 01:16:28,837
 I was not required to report it to declare it

860
01:16:28,893 --> 01:16:32,287
 as imported in Canada, even
though I did import it in Canada.

861
01:16:33,518 --> 01:16:38,812
I was not required to declare it. I did
not declare it. It's not a problem.

862
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:43,439
 The question is why is this?
because it is a good it is quite valuable.

863
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,767
And so on so we would the
tests that he applied to the coins.

864
01:16:47,914 --> 01:16:55,370
 The reason goods in general are not
immediately subject to the Customs Act

865
01:16:55,420 --> 01:17:02,067
 is because the Customs Act power is
given by the Excise Tax Act section 51

866
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,492
which which tells us that that authorities page 15

867
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,337
about 15 or 16

868
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,600
we're described where

869
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,300
maybe we can be more precise where

870
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:37,936
of course section 50(a)

871
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:44,503
sorry... 50(1)(b)

872
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,469
and then 51(1)

873
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:03,289
just a second one. I would just read it.

874
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,851
What do you say that section does?

875
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:18,362
This section tells us what the
purpose of the Customs Act

876
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:25,227
 is and is what activates the Customs Act
to act on things that are imported

877
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,380
So it's only on goods that are

878
01:18:36,437 --> 01:18:44,264
I'm not sure that I understand what you're saying
because 50 says that there shall be imposed

879
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:47,185
 a consumption tax.

880
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:53,300
on goods imported in Canada payable in 
accordance with the provision of the Custom Act

881
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,791
Yes.

882
01:18:56,467 --> 01:19:01,633
it doesn't say that you don't have to declare
something under the Customs Act

883
01:19:01,732 --> 01:19:03,732
because of the excise tax

884
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:09,987
It says that the Customs Act is unnecessary in the case.

885
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,000
No, no, it does not. You're correct.
This section does not.

886
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,945
Okay. So which section because you're

887
01:19:15,947 --> 01:19:17,847
section 51.

888
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:26,885
Shows the exemptions. 51(1) - the tax imposed by
section 50 does not apply on the sale or

889
01:19:27,081 --> 01:19:30,526
importation of goods mentioned in Schedule III

890
01:19:30,629 --> 01:19:33,929
Yes. So the fact that there's no tax

891
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,200
Why does it mean that you don't have

892
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:40,700
because there is no tax to be collected
in accordance with the Customs Act.

893
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,167
We'll have to look at the provisions
of the first [unintelligible]

894
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,521
I don't think it leaves you.

895
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:53,634
determine whether

896
01:19:54,500 --> 01:20:00,462
Do you recall the provision of the Customs Act that
says you declare only the goods on

897
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,300
which tax is payable?

898
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,900
The Customs Act does not do that. It does not activate itself.

899
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,900
No, but it doesn't say that you have to declare

900
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,895
only if there's tax

901
01:20:11,942 --> 01:20:13,942
It does not.

902
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,244
That is not the Customs Act's

903
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:24,400
job to do. The Customs Act only comes into
effect in case there is tax to be collected

904
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,628
And in case there is tax to be collected,

905
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:34,185
it is to be collected in accordance with the
Customs Act. That means you have to declare it and

906
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:36,159
you have to pay the tax.

907
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,988
Okay, that's your position.
That's fine. Your next point?

908
01:20:40,065 --> 01:20:45,398
And paragraph 51 at Schedule III part IX

909
01:20:51,504 --> 01:20:57,153
Page 20, which is one of the exemptions.

910
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,300
and on page 20 part 5

911
01:21:07,353 --> 01:21:13,400
It should be Part XI of Schedule III. It's on page 22

912
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,455
exemptions from importation tax

913
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,300
that is to be collected according
to the Customs Act

914
01:21:31,865 --> 01:21:38,464
So paragraph 3 and 4 of part XI state
that British and Canadian coins

915
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,316
and foreign gold coin

916
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,116
are exempted from importation tax

917
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,043
and the application of the Customs tax.

918
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:53,312
subparagraph 4 of part XI says

919
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:58,994
coin of any metal of authorized weight and
design issued for use as currency

920
01:21:59,217 --> 01:22:03,409
 under the authority of the government of any
country. So this would include the United States

921
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:05,953
 are exempt from

922
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:12,200
a importation tax and therefore collection of
the importation tax under the Customs Act

923
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:18,682
And it follows that if if there is no tax to be paid,

924
01:22:20,829 --> 01:22:27,800
and the Customs Act does not need to be enforced.
There's no point to declare things that not need to be

925
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:30,649
taxed and this is why

926
01:22:30,649 --> 01:22:32,474
 your point if I take it is that

927
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,200
no tax imposed on good, you do not have to
declare it when we come to the Border.

928
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:38,935
That is correct. 

929
01:22:39,518 --> 01:22:43,033
Following that logic, if someone arrived
at the border with fresh fruit

930
01:22:44,128 --> 01:22:46,878
From another country you're saying
it wouldn't have to.

931
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,588
declare that because no tax on it

932
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,789
In so far as the fruits... let's not
use fruit as an example

933
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:56,307
 because there's a agricultural

934
01:22:56,307 --> 01:23:00,027
 but where does that fit into the Customs Act?

935
01:23:00,826 --> 01:23:07,800
Fruits will not be declared under Customs.
It would be declared under the Agriculture Act.

936
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:11,214
you're saying a separate Act
requires you to declare fruit

937
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:17,803
Yes, but not one for taxation purposes, but
for germs and for other certification purposes,

938
01:23:18,096 --> 01:23:23,296
 well, let's use a car, your personal car or an
object that is not subject to the Agricultural Act

939
01:23:23,682 --> 01:23:28,764
Like the coins like inner objects, the car
that I was driving was not subject to

940
01:23:29,332 --> 01:23:31,332
the importation tax

941
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,780
But but did you buy that car in the United States?

942
01:23:34,817 --> 01:23:35,699
 I did not.

943
01:23:35,747 --> 01:23:38,159
 so guess that depends on what
the word "imported" means.

944
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:42,955
Does the word "imported" only mean bringing goods
 that you acquired outside the country

945
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:47,207
as opposed to returning Goods that came from
Canada and are bringing back to Canada

946
01:23:47,298 --> 01:23:52,086
You Honour, I believe that's incorrect.
I believe the distinction is not

947
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,225
on what "importation" means
but on whether a tax payable.

948
01:23:56,281 --> 01:24:00,540
The car was no doubt imported because it
was outside the country in the morning,

949
01:24:00,555 --> 01:24:03,869
It was inside the country in the afternoon.

950
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:08,676
... semantics ...

951
01:24:11,082 --> 01:24:17,205
so, can you remind me of the section, my
material doesn't have it and I'm going to

952
01:24:17,315 --> 01:24:20,285
 go look for it later my book of
authorities, unfortunately, or

953
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:25,442
There's a problem with it. Yeah, so, can you
just repeat to me exactly

954
01:24:25,492 --> 01:24:27,547
So Schedule III Part IX...

955
01:24:27,547 --> 01:24:28,823
Part XI

956
01:24:28,823 --> 01:24:30,545
 That's where I wasn't clear and I didn't have it.

957
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:38,139
I'm sorry. It just Schedule II Part XI Points 3 and 4.

958
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:39,341
Okay. Thank you.

959
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:49,965
If you bring for example other foodstuffs that are
for example chips or things that are not subject

960
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:52,018
to agricultural controls.

961
01:24:52,247 --> 01:24:57,541
 You do not have to report it to report it.
In fact many people drive to cross the border

962
01:24:57,565 --> 01:25:00,959
to buy their groceries and they come back.

963
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:07,025
Does not have to be reported. The same day that I
came in with these coins, I have also bought some

964
01:25:07,142 --> 01:25:12,931
bottle of water and some headache medication. I
had a headache that day. Medication is also exempt

965
01:25:12,931 --> 01:25:14,800
 from taxation.

966
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,840
which is the reason why I did not have to report it.

967
01:25:17,755 --> 01:25:23,128
My car did not have to be reported because tax on it
had already been paid when the car was initially

968
01:25:23,128 --> 01:25:25,000
imported into Canada. So

969
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,959
it was not subject because it was not something on which

970
01:25:29,904 --> 01:25:32,345
you had already paid the tax

971
01:25:32,358 --> 01:25:36,600
because there was no tax owing, there
was no tax due to be collected

972
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,700
It's not because it wasn't imported

973
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:44,851
Okay, so we got your point now we have to hurry
because you have to complete this in 5 minutes

974
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,879
Based on

975
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:59,018
the evidence submitted by the defendant which was
only the Customs Act, is the only evidence he had

976
01:25:59,055 --> 01:26:05,166
to offer in support of his position that the goods
are money, the judge found that

977
01:26:05,203 --> 01:26:07,878
that position and that evidence is not helpful to

978
01:26:07,879 --> 01:26:13,979
to his to his point and he found that in fact
according to the Currency Act, the coins are in

979
01:26:14,015 --> 01:26:17,452
fact currency and legal tender in the United States or

980
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,291
and they are not "goods"

981
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,200
according to the Customs Act

982
01:26:22,754 --> 01:26:26,715
well, he found that they were

983
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,694
not according to the evidence
submitted by the defendant

984
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,200
Okay, what's your point

985
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,322
in order for him to find that they were "goods",
he had to introduce some evidence of his own.

986
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:43,000
that was nothing that was based on what the
defendant said. The defendant never...

987
01:26:43,019 --> 01:26:46,587
can you point the paragraph

988
01:26:46,609 --> 01:26:51,446
you used the word "evidence" [unintelligible]
that's why I don't understand you

989
01:26:51,469 --> 01:26:54,279
Are you refering to how he defined "money"?

990
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,200
Yes, the definition of "money" from
the Excise Tax Act

991
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,771
Okay, so

992
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,928
You mean that he's bringing up an
argument that was not put to him

993
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,328
Is that what you're saying.. it wasn't argued?

994
01:27:09,328 --> 01:27:10,700
That is correct

995
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:16,243
Okay, so it was a new argument that
was not put by the parties before?

996
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:20,070
Okay, that's a different a. Yeah.

997
01:27:21,592 --> 01:27:23,989
And which paragraph?

998
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,413
Okay decision.

999
01:27:53,746 --> 01:28:03,229
paragraph 60 of the decision

1000
01:28:03,454 --> 01:28:07,235
That's the definition of "money" in the Excise Tax

1001
01:28:07,179 --> 01:28:10,462
and that was definately before him...
the "Excise Tax Act"

1002
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,300
this definition was not, Your Honour

1003
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:17,153
No, but that Act was before him. Once you put an Act

1004
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,003
The judge has to look at that the Act as a whole.
He cannot just read at the At and

1005
01:28:21,003 --> 01:28:22,500
 not look at the definition

1006
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:29,100
However, the defendant did not submit that this
is the reason why he thinks the coins are

1007
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,800
yes, but it's a matter of law.

1008
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:38,227
See, matters of law you can agree you can say...
it's the judge who gets to decide

1009
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:43,990
So the Act was before him, it's not like he
looked Act that he didn't know about

1010
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:48,815
This definition of money is not normative

1011
01:28:48,852 --> 01:28:54,718
Its context is specific to section 123

1012
01:28:54,684 --> 01:29:01,061
 Unfortunately this is a very long section; the
definitions is very long. I did not include it in my

1013
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:09,316
authority, but at the heading of it says that this
definition only applies for that subsection

1014
01:29:09,307 --> 01:29:16,302
 It's not a general definition of "money", which
does not exist. In Canadian law we do not have a

1015
01:29:16,322 --> 01:29:21,588
legal definition for what "money" is this.
This is only a placeholder

1016
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,500
to save rewriting the same long paragraph

1017
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:34,407
Okay, so it cannot be just for the purpose
 of 123. It has to be for the purpose of Part IX.

1018
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,700
The definition

1019
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:44,430
is adapted in part IX subsection 123. So what
you're saying, it applies only to the part or

1020
01:29:44,815 --> 01:29:46,815
 wherever it says that it applies.

1021
01:29:46,818 --> 01:29:47,907
That is correct.

1022
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:49,300
Not in another act.

1023
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,100
That's correct.

1024
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,000
Okay, that's good.

1025
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,500
So what did he do that with that? I don't think that he

1026
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:03,300
so this was the only basis on which he
found the coins can be considered "goods"

1027
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,857
Nothing in the defendants or the plaintiff's
representations gave

1028
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,300
Any evidence that they can be considered "goods"?

1029
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,300
Too long. How many arguments you have left?

1030
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,604
I have

1031
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:57,500
just raise them, because we we cannot

1032
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:04,277
okay Your Honor the para of 53 of the reasons where
 the judge followed an analysis of what coins are

1033
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:08,844
currency, but he concludes that reporting under
section 12 of the Customs Act.

1034
01:31:08,887 --> 01:31:12,339
It is the

1035
01:31:12,448 --> 01:31:20,547
53 talks only about the Proceeds Act and the Mint
Act, he doesn't talk about the Customs Act.

1036
01:31:20,481 --> 01:31:26,011
About half way down, 4th line down, he says "the
reporting obligations provided for in section

1037
01:31:26,173 --> 01:31:28,173
12(1) of the Customs Act are therefore triggered"

1038
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,800
Yes, but you were under 10,000.

1039
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,400
My point is that I believe this is a

1040
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:38,331
it doesn't apply to you

1041
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,300
It doesn't apply to me, but if it should.
The limit of 10,000 should apply to me.

1042
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,600
Yes, so

1043
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,700
in case I did have more than 10,000
I should have had to to report them.

1044
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,166
Yes, but he does say that it is triggered

1045
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:59,320
Yes, he uses the words "the reporting obligations
provided under section 12 of the Customs Act"

1046
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,563
his analysis pertained to

1047
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,347
I don't see the word Custom Act here

1048
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,711
He uses Proceeds Act

1049
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:14,800
in the first sentence, but the second sentence
he talks about the reporting obligations.

1050
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:21,906
the reporting obligation provided for
at section 12(1) of the Proceeds Act

1051
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:23,759
"Proceeds Act"

1052
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,321
Not Customs

1053
01:32:31,157 --> 01:32:34,320
My decision says... Customs Act

1054
01:32:34,356 --> 01:32:35,135
Rivoalen: Really?

1055
01:32:35,141 --> 01:32:36,013
Gauthier: Really?

1056
01:32:37,925 --> 01:32:39,925
(Gauthier) That's incredible

1057
01:32:49,901 --> 01:32:51,901
(Gauthier) That's incredible

1058
01:32:59,534 --> 01:33:01,534
(Gauthier) Counsel, do you have...

1059
01:32:56,076 --> 01:32:57,125
(Rivoalen) On the...

1060
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:03,305
(Peterson) Yeah, mine says Proceeds

1061
01:33:07,003 --> 01:33:10,819
Frankly.. ok, so we agree that

1062
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:13,324
if the official version is Proceeds Act

1063
01:33:13,334 --> 01:33:14,356
that would be the correct, yes

1064
01:33:14,369 --> 01:33:16,999
Perfect. So we'll leave that.

1065
01:33:17,007 --> 01:33:18,019
Okay, so

1066
01:33:18,003 --> 01:33:19,003
so this point falls

1067
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,255
It may have been corrected.
I know that this was corrected...

1068
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,900
could the judge have ammended that
at some point for errors?

1069
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:30,258
Not that I recall.

1070
01:33:30,254 --> 01:33:31,284
Okay, that's fine.

1071
01:33:31,294 --> 01:33:32,357
Ok, go ahead, sorry

1072
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:38,756
Did you get this from the website,
instead of the official version

1073
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:43,311
Your Honour, there were so many, I'm not sure where

1074
01:33:43,328 --> 01:33:45,886
Because, you see, what they transcribe on the website

1075
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:48,847
they could make a mistake in transcribing

1076
01:33:48,853 --> 01:33:50,573
This would be a huge mistake to make

1077
01:33:50,562 --> 01:33:53,534
that from the official version
it's definitely Proceeds

1078
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:59,402
Well, I will take your word. I believe this is a huge
mistake to make and it would be impossible

1079
01:33:59,623 --> 01:34:00,995
So let's go to the next one

1080
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:02,266
the next one.

1081
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:09,119
In paragraph 57...

1082
01:34:09,323 --> 01:34:10,582
of the decision

1083
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:22,242
he does talk about what activates the Customs Act,
but overlooks specifically section 50(1)(b)

1084
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:26,819
Which deals with the importation;
he only generally looks at

1085
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,400
The Excise Tax Act, probably, maybe, might not even if

1086
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,800
you can write. Okay next.

1087
01:34:33,927 --> 01:34:37,736
Because we don't have a choice. We have other
appeals this afternoon and

1088
01:34:37,736 --> 01:34:39,500
your friend is entitled to his time.

1089
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:43,717
Your Honour, on a

1090
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,400
motion for summary judgment

1091
01:34:46,411 --> 01:34:50,248
It should be

1092
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:57,343
should not be granted in case

1093
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,575
a confident opinion cannot be made.

1094
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:09,165
 in order to grant a summary judgement the
judge needs to have confidence in his

1095
01:35:09,229 --> 01:35:13,933
 so sufficient evidence must be available that he
can confidently determine the matter.

1096
01:35:13,915 --> 01:35:16,661
 If the matter cannot be determined confidently

1097
01:35:16,652 --> 01:35:18,652
Yes, but he felt that he had it

1098
01:35:19,543 --> 01:35:21,543
He said that he felt it,

1099
01:35:21,821 --> 01:35:23,961
however, he had

1100
01:35:23,952 --> 01:35:28,473
that one is a very difficult point to convince us

1101
01:35:28,488 --> 01:35:29,497
Is there a paragraph

1102
01:35:29,514 --> 01:35:32,697
Yes, Your Honour, paragraph 58 of the decision

1103
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,331
I'm sorry, it's 68.

1104
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,182
68

1105
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:48,814
"having concluded both the Customs and Proceeds
Act apply concurrently. I will address the issue

1106
01:35:48,837 --> 01:35:51,100
of overlapping provisions."

1107
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:56,360
And then he discusses the at paragraph 70,
"The courts have recognized that

1108
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,800
the scope and application..."

1109
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,914
Okay.

1110
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,879
And he talks about conflict and overlap.

1111
01:36:00,889 --> 01:36:02,074
Okay,

1112
01:36:02,075 --> 01:36:03,989
so that's the wording of conflict.

1113
01:36:04,022 --> 01:36:06,078
Yes.

1114
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:10,962
You're saying that his use of the words conflict
and overlap shows uncertainty

1115
01:36:11,213 --> 01:36:12,347
Absolutely.

1116
01:36:16,918 --> 01:36:20,035
Another paragraph, 65

1117
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:31,489
"the plaintiff has not argued that the
coins, if found to be goods,

1118
01:36:31,543 --> 01:36:35,687
 are exempt from reporting requirements,
set out at subsection 12(1)"

1119
01:36:35,863 --> 01:36:42,437
however, the plaintiff did exactly this, in the

1120
01:36:42,783 --> 01:36:47,721
page 118, which is part of the motion record.

1121
01:36:53,726 --> 01:36:54,900
So

1122
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:59,100
So, page 118 [uninteligible], paragraph 9

1123
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:10,700
Exactly that point,

1124
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,845
okay.

1125
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:19,000
So 65 page paragraph 9. Okay next.

1126
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:25,900
You are pet the other significant errors that had.

1127
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,351
felt was

1128
01:37:32,377 --> 01:37:36,644
an appeal under section 135 is

1129
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:41,106
an appeal for judicial review by the Customs Act

1130
01:37:41,417 --> 01:37:46,796
So it means that there should have been a standard
of review stated, and he should have reviewed

1131
01:37:46,898 --> 01:37:48,898
 the decision of the minister.

1132
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,726
Not to try to reach his own decision
based on fresh evidence.

1133
01:37:54,987 --> 01:38:00,491
No, but because it's on fresh evidence,
it cannot be a judicial review.

1134
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:01,728
But there is

1135
01:38:01,776 --> 01:38:06,600
un-french that a new evidence.
That's the purpose of doing it by way of action.

1136
01:38:07,355 --> 01:38:08,457
No, Your Honor.

1137
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,050
but as part of

1138
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,200
I'm very sorry. I have to disagree.

1139
01:38:13,175 --> 01:38:16,282
No, okay, but let's do this quickly

1140
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:22,700
I'm faced with an impossible task of
proving a huge case in a very short time.

1141
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:24,917
It's three hours.

1142
01:38:24,917 --> 01:38:26,264
I understand.

1143
01:38:26,264 --> 01:38:29,000
We are bound by the Chief Justice duration.

1144
01:38:29,914 --> 01:38:31,213
We cannot extend.

1145
01:38:31,251 --> 01:38:33,251
May I request an adjurment?

1146
01:38:33,251 --> 01:38:34,846
NO!

1147
01:38:34,846 --> 01:38:41,050
Would you make your point the
last point talking about the judicial review

1148
01:38:41,133 --> 01:38:46,857
Your Honour, in order to do a judicial review, the
judge would have had to consider the Minister's

1149
01:38:46,966 --> 01:38:49,709
 consideration of the evidence before him,

1150
01:38:49,756 --> 01:38:54,005
and whether he reached a conclusion in
an intelligible manner

1151
01:38:54,182 --> 01:38:59,396
according to Dunsmuir Supreme Court Case 2008

1152
01:38:59,372 --> 01:39:01,578
We're aware of Dunsmuir

1153
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:06,284
so the minister's decision
would have had to be intelligible

1154
01:39:06,366 --> 01:39:11,295
 so that the plaintiff has a chance to
defend against it

1155
01:39:11,339 --> 01:39:14,564
and such that a reviewing court
would understand how it was made.

1156
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,726
He was not deciding the action

1157
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:20,785
he was deciding a summary judgment
based on a question of law.

1158
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:28,642
So if you say it was not enough to
determine that question to

1159
01:39:28,658 --> 01:39:32,828
 to strike the action, say that,
and then we'll pass the next one.

1160
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:36,900
Because there are two different things.
He was not deciding the action.

1161
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:42,611
He was deciding whether there was a genuine issue.

1162
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:47,195
Yes a genuine issue about whether or not

1163
01:39:47,347 --> 01:39:50,768
the coins were "goods" that had to be declared.

1164
01:39:55,676 --> 01:39:58,270
the claims in the the action were

1165
01:39:58,966 --> 01:40:05,195
that a review was requested,
so he had to find whether the review would be

1166
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,907
I think we understand your point.

1167
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,963
What I didn't mention is that in order

1168
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:19,921
My point is that the Minister's
Decision is unintelligible

1169
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,767
and this alone should have been ground to find that

1170
01:40:22,778 --> 01:40:26,854
the decision should be set aside,
even before looking at whether the goods.

1171
01:40:27,835 --> 01:40:30,451
That is all I have.

1172
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,500
You didn't need an extra adjournment.

1173
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,300
Well, that is all I can say
in the time that I've been given.

1174
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:41,200
Yes, and that's been...
you've covered all your points.

1175
01:40:41,945 --> 01:40:43,235
So thank you very much.

1176
01:40:43,252 --> 01:40:47,797
You've done very well and you will have
a short time for replaying after you hear the other

1177
01:40:47,936 --> 01:40:49,093
Okay?

1178
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:50,582
Thank you.

1179
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,200
So, Your Honor in terms of the amendment appeal

1180
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:01,500
If you've read the Crown's
memorandum of fact and law.

1181
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:07,118
The issue is really covered all very squarely by
the decision of this Court in [Taleb?]

1182
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:13,080
 and I don't propose to take you through it,
that sets out the standard of review very clearly.

1183
01:41:13,164 --> 01:41:17,545
 And in fact, this case rests squarely
on the [Taleb?] case.

1184
01:41:17,672 --> 01:41:20,587
is the only case that cited for the proposition

1185
01:41:20,591 --> 01:41:25,234
was the judge looking at the,

1186
01:41:25,423 --> 01:41:30,802
prospect of success under 221(a) or
was he looking at it under another

1187
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:36,200
So the Crown submission is that
the standard of review would apply to both.

1188
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:40,913
As either (a) or (b), and so in this case...

1189
01:41:40,893 --> 01:41:43,546
No, but it's not a question of standard of review,

1190
01:41:43,596 --> 01:41:49,582
 the question is Messieur advanced that
you cannot look at evidence

1191
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:55,267
I'm not sure that it's right,
without evidence, that was the point

1192
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:59,877
So no evidence is required to a uphold
Justice Gleeson's decision

1193
01:41:59,853 --> 01:42:02,609
 that the Amendments have no Prospect of success.

1194
01:42:02,693 --> 01:42:08,355
 He was entitled to look at the the pleadings
on their face the proposed amendments

1195
01:42:08,528 --> 01:42:10,514
without getting into any evidence beyond that

1196
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:12,500
and that was your position before.

1197
01:42:12,528 --> 01:42:13,647
Yes

1198
01:42:13,661 --> 01:42:16,412
reading the pleadings per se.

1199
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:22,136
It was enough to come a "no reasonable
prospect on the cause of action" to strike

1200
01:42:22,311 --> 01:42:24,311
Yes

1201
01:42:29,122 --> 01:42:32,337
It was like a 221(1)(a)

1202
01:42:32,386 --> 01:42:33,469
Yes.

1203
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:37,009
Okay

1204
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:41,266
And then, with respect to the
second appeal for summary judgement 

1205
01:42:41,301 --> 01:42:45,867
the test of course is set very clearly
that Justice Gleason was to consider

1206
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:48,351
 the test being in Hryniak and Maildin

1207
01:42:48,835 --> 01:42:52,488
 that case also sets out the
standard of review for this court,

1208
01:42:52,525 --> 01:42:56,362
an appellate review, at the
first level or the second level

1209
01:42:56,614 --> 01:43:00,738
In fact, it deals with the appellate review
at the Supreme Court level.

1210
01:43:01,077 --> 01:43:06,261
The Crown submission is that that same standard
applies in this court in dealing with motion for

1211
01:43:06,279 --> 01:43:09,397
 summary judgment where
the Federal Court deals with it

1212
01:43:10,533 --> 01:43:13,906
by a judge, rather than
a prothonotary at first instance

1213
01:43:13,872 --> 01:43:18,790
What I don't understand in your motion is,
first you make it under 221

1214
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,600
You agree that 221 is a motion to strike.

1215
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,700
Yes

1216
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:29,027
215 is the Rule for the summary judgement, so, and

1217
01:43:30,417 --> 01:43:36,271
frankly, I have some difficulty and
that's why I'm raising it just speaking

1218
01:43:36,259 --> 01:43:39,868
 for myself at this stage and we
haven't decided anything but

1219
01:43:39,904 --> 01:43:43,003
I have some difficulty with the argument.

1220
01:43:44,138 --> 01:43:49,434
that you cannot have an Action

1221
01:43:49,719 --> 01:43:52,355
that would include different parts

1222
01:43:53,660 --> 01:44:00,550
and the whole pupose, if it were true
that you have to have 135 on its own

1223
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:07,925
Then, I don't see under what authority one
would strike, completely kill the other parts,

1224
01:44:08,274 --> 01:44:12,826
rather than remove them and
separate them as different Action.

1225
01:44:12,872 --> 01:44:18,002
There you would have to you know,
maybe bring a motion to strike under 221.

1226
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:22,173
Either because no reasonable cause
or prejudice and whatever,

1227
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:26,135
 if you want to have evidence, but you can't do

1228
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:33,071
I just can't understand why you say
"I'm going to strike other claims"

1229
01:44:33,158 --> 01:44:37,654
just because you feel that 135 should be on its own.

1230
01:44:38,627 --> 01:44:41,608
 It's like substance over... form over substance.

1231
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:48,208
The Crown did bring a motion to strike and
that was dismissed by Prothonotary Milczynski,

1232
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:54,044
she suggested that a motion for summary
judgement might be more appropriate.

1233
01:44:54,146 --> 01:44:58,650
And your motion to strike was in
respect to which portion of the action?

1234
01:44:59,218 --> 01:45:03,714
Again, related to the question of law,
it simply boiled down to

1235
01:45:03,766 --> 01:45:09,376
 whether the conduct at issue could be resolved by
 determining whether the coins are "goods" or not.

1236
01:45:09,924 --> 01:45:16,875
But how can that be determinative
of the other claims included?

1237
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:23,313
Because that is the only conduct
that was at issue in the Plaintiff's claim

1238
01:45:23,322 --> 01:45:29,729
Let's have a look and explain it to us, because
I don't see it when I read the Statement of Claim.

1239
01:45:29,712 --> 01:45:34,061
Of course. The claim can be framed
however a plaintiff wishes and

1240
01:45:34,132 --> 01:45:38,550
it can be very expansive particularly
where the plaintiff is acting in person.

1241
01:45:38,695 --> 01:45:44,920
but nonetheless the only issue that
 the Federal Court will consider

1242
01:45:44,957 --> 01:45:48,748
 is the question of, in this case,
whether the coins are "goods"

1243
01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:53,724
 and Justice Gleeson was very clear
about that point, that section...

1244
01:45:53,724 --> 01:45:57,568
the Customs Act provides a
very limited review in this...

1245
01:45:57,625 --> 01:45:59,735
 It's not really an ordinary action at all.

1246
01:45:59,901 --> 01:46:01,794
 It's a statutory appeal by way of Action

1247
01:46:01,825 --> 01:46:04,500
You're changing course here.

1248
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:05,583
key to

1249
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,901
this would be the key question
to all the claims because

1250
01:46:09,928 --> 01:46:15,089
my question to you is not whether you
can put them in the same proceeding,

1251
01:46:15,149 --> 01:46:17,845
which is procedural. Okay?

1252
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:22,800
What courts do when things are put
together, that should not be put together,

1253
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:25,641
we separate them

1254
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,600
They don't just strike it.

1255
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,727
Unless there is no merit, but you have to

1256
01:46:31,756 --> 01:46:34,214
have a motion looking at the merit
of the other stuff.

1257
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:40,015
If you're saying to me and that's
what I heard that this one question

1258
01:46:40,089 --> 01:46:45,693
 was determinative of all of the other claims,
that's a different story

1259
01:46:46,021 --> 01:46:48,293
 but I couldn't see it when I read it

1260
01:46:48,892 --> 01:46:53,574
When I read the Statement of Claim,
it was not evident to me

1261
01:46:53,597 --> 01:46:56,087
maybe just because I didn't see it, you know.

1262
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:59,089
you can say that

1263
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,759
That one question. Are they "goods"?

1264
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,700
Is enough to determine the
merits of all the other claims?

1265
01:47:07,918 --> 01:47:12,830
I take your point, but obviously
Justice Gleeson felt differently,

1266
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,505
 and the Crown supports his position.

1267
01:47:14,529 --> 01:47:16,305
But that's why we're a Court of Appeal!

1268
01:47:16,305 --> 01:47:19,272
Okay, so that he thinks
differently is another story

1269
01:47:19,561 --> 01:47:26,449
and the Crown submits that the only
issue that required any review whatsoever,

1270
01:47:26,506 --> 01:47:29,055
 whether it's by summary judgment or at a trial,

1271
01:47:29,112 --> 01:47:34,200
of the Plaintiff's claim was whether
the coins are "goods"

1272
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:41,200
I assume that you tried to convince him of that.
So now is your time to try convince us

1273
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,900
But that's the point here

1274
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:49,376
if the coins are not "goods", then
clearly the defendant loses the case. Full stop.

1275
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:51,845
and if the coins are "goods"

1276
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:57,138
What else is available to my friend
under a statutory appeal if this is not an Action

1277
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:58,900
You would lose what case?

1278
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:01,629
You would lose the case for punitive damages,

1279
01:48:01,692 --> 01:48:08,446
you would lose the case for Declaration
that the Minister of Public Safety has a policy

1280
01:48:08,709 --> 01:48:14,968
 aiding crime and terrorism in Canada,
what would you be losing?

1281
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:16,682
I think it's fair to say that 

1282
01:48:16,755 --> 01:48:21,920
Justice Gleeson felt that there was
no prospect of success for those claims.

1283
01:48:22,832 --> 01:48:29,391
There may not have been a specific motion
before him at the time to strike those claims,

1284
01:48:29,787 --> 01:48:36,558
 but a motion had as I said in brought
previously to strike and had been dismissed.

1285
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,164
So that's not very good for you.

1286
01:48:39,319 --> 01:48:44,081
what I mean is that it's not a judge
looking at a claim without a motion.

1287
01:48:44,132 --> 01:48:50,653
because there is another party.
We have an adversarial, so somebody,

1288
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:54,708
In this case, Mr.

1289
01:48:55,797 --> 01:49:02,579
Mr Hociung has the right to present
his argument as to whether to be struck.

1290
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:03,729
Yes. So

1291
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:05,451
you can't start from there

1292
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:12,133
If the court disagrees with Justice Gleeson
that those ancillary claims should not

1293
01:49:12,164 --> 01:49:15,282
have been struck, then,
if you if you follow through

1294
01:49:15,314 --> 01:49:19,669
on that proposition, then you can make a
determination on the motion for

1295
01:49:19,654 --> 01:49:21,654
summary judgement whether the coins are "goods",

1296
01:49:21,855 --> 01:49:25,492
 and allow the rest of the claims to proceed
and send it back to Federal Court

1297
01:49:25,563 --> 01:49:27,563
and rest assured my client will move to strike.

1298
01:49:27,967 --> 01:49:32,733
Okay, but you see my point. You just ...
We're a court of law.

1299
01:49:32,768 --> 01:49:38,098
 You can't say "Ok, we're going to take shortcuts
because we don't want people to spend

1300
01:49:38,434 --> 01:49:41,037
money for nothing". We just can't do that.

1301
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,112
I take your point

1302
01:49:43,316 --> 01:49:45,971
and here, it may well be that you're right

1303
01:49:48,176 --> 01:49:52,657
but I just can't see how you can strike
other claims without even looking at their merit

1304
01:49:53,661 --> 01:50:00,641
okay, and your argument about
135, you see my point.

1305
01:50:00,767 --> 01:50:06,313
If you had struck or sought under
106 to separate those

1306
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:13,225
then you'd be fine, but I don't see how you ...

1307
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:18,105
I just and I'm not talking for my
colleague, just me, so convinced me.

1308
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:25,212
you know, if you think you can,
but procedure. He has a 135

1309
01:50:25,297 --> 01:50:26,413
Yes,

1310
01:50:26,422 --> 01:50:31,253
he has a write of action. Maybe for damages
and for whatnot. Maybe he's wrong.

1311
01:50:31,263 --> 01:50:34,177
Maybe he's gonna lose, he has no case, or whatever.

1312
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:38,345
but we can't just say because put them
in the same Statement of Claim

1313
01:50:38,598 --> 01:50:41,026
[unintelligible] ...they would be time barred

1314
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:46,636
Well, for sure, for a case whether the
ruled that the coins are "goods",

1315
01:50:46,658 --> 01:50:50,337
 it's difficult to conceive that he would
have a claim for punitive damages

1316
01:50:50,702 --> 01:50:55,470
Because he hasn't alleged that he was
mistreated in any way by border officers

1317
01:50:55,466 --> 01:50:57,666
Then you'll have an easy job on the motion to strike

1318
01:50:57,706 --> 01:50:58,764
Yes.

1319
01:50:58,799 --> 01:51:02,770
Okay. Now, have you considered,
and do you have something

1320
01:51:02,963 --> 01:51:06,999
 [unintelligible] I'm in a bind because
I don't know the case at this stage

1321
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:11,606
is the Crown under 3(1)(b)

1322
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:16,400
from your understanding is
vicariously responsible for fraud

1323
01:51:16,435 --> 01:51:18,468
For [unintelligible] outside of their duty

1324
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:22,700
So that would be easy for you to produce cases.

1325
01:51:24,157 --> 01:51:28,762
And Messieur has until June 6

1326
01:51:28,828 --> 01:51:29,872
June 7th

1327
01:51:29,904 --> 01:51:32,003
June 7th, so many days do you need to

1328
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,200
as many as you [unintelligible],
but I don't need much time.

1329
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:41,700
So an extra two days because you'll start
looking now, of course, so by the 9th,

1330
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:43,175
yes.

1331
01:51:51,893 --> 01:51:53,211
so that is done...

1332
01:51:53,276 --> 01:51:55,276
and you realize that

1333
01:51:56,237 --> 01:51:59,359
and I'm raising this for both sides

1334
01:51:59,351 --> 01:52:05,950
if we were to say that the rest has to go back

1335
01:52:05,968 --> 01:52:12,884
there may be a jurisdiction problem
and a time limitation problem.

1336
01:52:13,473 --> 01:52:19,949
Time limitation if it is within 106,
and if it is not within 106

1337
01:52:20,206 --> 01:52:26,854
you can still have a cause of action
against the officer, but if that is so,

1338
01:52:26,956 --> 01:52:32,763
this court has no jurisdiction.
I'm just raising this so you know.

1339
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,355
that when we send it back, there may be
a lot more hurdle under other than

1340
01:52:38,426 --> 01:52:43,206
 reasonable cause of action on its face just
because of the wording in the

1341
01:52:43,237 --> 01:52:46,261
time limitation and whatnot.

1342
01:52:47,298 --> 01:52:48,306
Yes.

1343
01:52:48,318 --> 01:52:49,900
Okay, you're all following on that.

1344
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:50,930
I am. Yes,

1345
01:52:50,956 --> 01:52:52,034
okay.

1346
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:57,700
Okay. Now you want to say anything
else about the Amendments or are you

1347
01:52:58,156 --> 01:53:05,013
102, Mr Hociung raised a lot of error

1348
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:06,400
Yes

1349
01:53:06,421 --> 01:53:11,821
You made a statement that the ancilliary
thing should not have been struck

1350
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:14,491
Can you show me where they were struck?

1351
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:17,166
They weren't stuck. It's just that ...

1352
01:53:17,157 --> 01:53:21,207
We usually make a comment that it should not
have been struck. Couldn't find where it actually

1353
01:53:21,265 --> 01:53:26,545
So in fact, no, that's correct, your Honour.
They were not actually struck.

1354
01:53:26,556 --> 01:53:30,701
He simply decided the issue about
whether the coins are "goods"

1355
01:53:30,738 --> 01:53:34,762
and then of course... so whether
the coins are are "currency" and

1356
01:53:34,763 --> 01:53:38,313
 subject to his findings, he decided
to dismiss the entire action.

1357
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:39,900
with he didn't strike it

1358
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:45,202
he dismissed the action

1359
01:53:45,353 --> 01:53:47,753
You realize how it becomes very important.

1360
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:52,142
Yes, you would have to find
that the ruling on coins as

1361
01:53:52,124 --> 01:53:57,872
 "goods" and "currency" was determinative
of all the claims in the plaintiff's claim.

1362
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:02,583
or that procedure form

1363
01:54:04,083 --> 01:54:05,402
Yes.

1364
01:54:05,489 --> 01:54:11,224
override the substance and you can just dismiss
because you happen to put it on

1365
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:13,967
 in the same Statement of Claim

1366
01:54:15,647 --> 01:54:16,982
Yes.

1367
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:26,349
So, in the Federal Court, the Crown took
the position that the coins are "goods",

1368
01:54:26,371 --> 01:54:29,945
 Justice Gleeson found that they are
both "goods" and "currency"

1369
01:54:29,964 --> 01:54:35,617
 and on appeal to this Court, the Crown is
happy to support Justice Gleeson's

1370
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:37,680
 ruling on both those points.

1371
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:44,244
The Crown referred to several pieces of
legislation before Justice Gleeson

1372
01:54:44,569 --> 01:54:48,546
The Crown repeats those submissions,
but in addition the Crown is relying

1373
01:54:48,948 --> 01:54:54,471
on the Customs Tariff which I cited in the
 memorandum, as well as two cases decided under the

1374
01:54:55,984 --> 01:55:02,700
federal Export and Import Permits Act.
Both are fairly old cases, but they made their

1375
01:55:04,424 --> 01:55:09,547
But we'll look through that... just a second.

1376
01:55:09,946 --> 01:55:16,883
In my own mind the first one I would like
you to clarify if you can is the proposition that

1377
01:55:16,952 --> 01:55:21,419
 if something there's no tax to be paid,
it doesn't need to be declared unless

1378
01:55:21,737 --> 01:55:25,486
there's an obligation to declare
under another Act

1379
01:55:25,571 --> 01:55:26,594
Right.

1380
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:27,901
Can you start with that?

1381
01:55:29,764 --> 01:55:36,375
That it's absolutely false; if a good exceeds
 the limit allowed for perfect goods purchased

1382
01:55:37,031 --> 01:55:40,132
 abroad during the trip to be declared it must be

1383
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:46,302
Absolutely must be reported. Even if no tax
 is to be paid on it in terms of custom duties

1384
01:55:46,346 --> 01:55:48,564
because there may be GST

1385
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:53,205
Okay. So where do we have that
provision that says "if you exceed you..."

1386
01:55:53,236 --> 01:55:56,397
you're talking about the $800 for 48 hours

1387
01:55:56,404 --> 01:55:57,480
Yes, that's all it is.

1388
01:55:57,488 --> 01:55:59,488
Where do we have that provision?

1389
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:05,000
So you're looking for the specific
provision in the Customs Act

1390
01:56:05,432 --> 01:56:10,303
yes, because you say that what he says is false

1391
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,142
easy to find it

1392
01:56:13,191 --> 01:56:18,991
so I reproduced provisions of the
Customs act that the end of my

1393
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:24,070
memorandum, but those
particular Provisions would

1394
01:56:24,489 --> 01:56:26,377
out in the regulations, which

1395
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:27,633
as you

1396
01:56:27,847 --> 01:56:31,047
not believe I have reproduced in full.

1397
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:36,100
So I would have to provide that
to you subsequently.

1398
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,661
We have the Custom Tariff,

1399
01:56:40,116 --> 01:56:41,257
Yes.

1400
01:56:41,269 --> 01:56:42,311
[unintelligible]

1401
01:56:42,315 --> 01:56:43,364
no

1402
01:56:43,367 --> 01:56:47,149
because you do realize that that
was one of his main arguments.

1403
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,318
throughout

1404
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,600
so it's a bit surprising that
it's not in the material

1405
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:54,698
Well, it's a bit of a surprising argument milady.

1406
01:56:54,707 --> 01:56:59,652
It's just because there is no duty owing
a good doesn't have to be reported.

1407
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:05,349
For example, let's take it
the keys out of this case.

1408
01:57:05,382 --> 01:57:11,476
If the goods are currency if their value
is an excess of 10,000 dollars

1409
01:57:11,727 --> 01:57:12,818
It's Proceeds.

1410
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,800
Yes, they have to be reported
but there's no tax upon those.

1411
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:18,400
Yes, but I think what Messieur

1412
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,800
said, he completed this when we asked about fruit

1413
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:26,400
there could be a series of other legislation

1414
01:57:26,405 --> 01:57:29,819
that would impose a duty to declare

1415
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:33,108
and that would be administered by the Customs

1416
01:57:33,137 --> 01:57:34,285
so

1417
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:42,039
We need something tangible other
than it makes no it's false. So.

1418
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:46,841
I thought that that argument was raised in the

1419
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:49,723
Apellant's memorandum

1420
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:56,736
It is, but I mean, are you asking for
the citation to the regulation that

1421
01:57:56,750 --> 01:58:00,915
Yes, I want a piece of
[unintelligible] or something or

1422
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,444
Do you have a case?

1423
01:58:02,444 --> 01:58:03,500
There's no case.

1424
01:58:03,528 --> 01:58:06,401
Ok, there's no case, then
something other than your word?

1425
01:58:06,868 --> 01:58:10,406
What I could do, what I can offer to the court, is

1426
01:58:10,394 --> 01:58:16,180
when the time comes for me to send in
the case law on the fraud of a public servant

1427
01:58:16,248 --> 01:58:20,003
I can provide as well to reference to the
specific provision in the regulation

1428
01:58:20,021 --> 01:58:22,251
that deals with the specific limits.

1429
01:58:22,291 --> 01:58:27,999
We don't want to extend this overly,
so if you could provide that within...

1430
01:58:28,085 --> 01:58:35,016
... until, before the next Wedesday which is the
time that Messieur is coming back from wherever,

1431
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:39,651
then he can answer about this in his letter

1432
01:58:39,758 --> 01:58:45,026
that provides the answer for
3(1)(b) of the Crown Liability

1433
01:58:45,059 --> 01:58:47,713
fraud cover or not, you follow me?

1434
01:58:48,598 --> 01:58:55,443
The second section will be whatever you have to say
about the regulation that is being raised in the

1435
01:58:58,098 --> 01:59:03,700
This is not a memorandum. Okay, all
this must not be more than five pages.

1436
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,985
all this.
Ok... very well.

1437
01:59:08,238 --> 01:59:10,564
But to apply that...

1438
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:16,527
I just want that to be put in the minutes

1439
01:59:18,953 --> 01:59:20,513
The 29th

1440
01:59:21,507 --> 01:59:25,702
Perfect.

1441
01:59:28,021 --> 01:59:34,962
You need to put that into a context

1442
01:59:38,485 --> 01:59:45,356
you say in your view, everything that is over
 the limit must be declared, whether or not

1443
01:59:45,384 --> 01:59:47,108
there is taxation

1444
01:59:47,332 --> 01:59:53,599
... but how can it be over the limit
if there is no tax on it?

1445
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:00,745
Because he.. the plaintiff paid, and this is
uncontradicted in the evidence, USD $2700, for

1446
02:00:03,535 --> 02:00:10,358
these ... USD $5700 for these coins when in fact
 that represented 29.5 times their face value.

1447
02:00:11,547 --> 02:00:12,893
So

1448
02:00:12,964 --> 02:00:18,561
So there's an obligation to disclose it
just because it was over his exemption

1449
02:00:18,598 --> 02:00:20,598
 whether or not there was tax on it.

1450
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:27,408
OK. And are you going to address your
interpretation of those

1451
02:00:27,432 --> 02:00:29,432
provisions that you push us through?

1452
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:30,513
Yes.

1453
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:37,000
Unless you have any further questions.
Those are all my submissions.

1454
02:00:39,410 --> 02:00:45,164
I asked you whether you're gonna take us
through those provisions, and you said "Yes"

1455
02:00:45,206 --> 02:00:49,361
Which.. so the provisions that you asked
about, the regulations, the limits.

1456
02:00:49,658 --> 02:00:55,854
no, no... He said section 11 of the Currency

1457
02:00:55,969 --> 02:01:02,376
he went through... several errors,

1458
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:10,331
such as not considering section 11
of the Currency Act

1459
02:01:11,973 --> 02:01:18,528
and [unintelligible] that exempts
foreign and whatnot

1460
02:01:19,735 --> 02:01:26,372
well milady I have I mean I can take you through
Justice Gleeson's decision and detail,

1461
02:01:26,331 --> 02:01:31,233
 but the Supreme Court of Canada
has said that, you know, the

1462
02:01:31,559 --> 02:01:35,447
The appellate Court does not need to
conduct the same analysis that

1463
02:01:35,464 --> 02:01:37,343
was conducted by the Federal Court.

1464
02:01:37,343 --> 02:01:39,087
Sorry. This is a question of law.

1465
02:01:39,097 --> 02:01:40,139
Yes

1466
02:01:40,139 --> 02:01:41,221
Question of law.

1467
02:01:41,259 --> 02:01:42,270
Yes

1468
02:01:42,279 --> 02:01:45,106
Okay. So are we clear that on
question of law is correctness?

1469
02:01:45,113 --> 02:01:46,139
Yes.

1470
02:01:46,143 --> 02:01:50,723
Okay, so why are not are we
not conducting it ourselves?

1471
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:54,530
So his question was that Justice Gleeson is...

1472
02:01:54,583 --> 02:01:58,808
Argument is that Justice Gleeson did not
consider section 11 of the Currency Act

1473
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:05,895
just because that particular section is not
referred to expressly in Justice Gleeson's

1474
02:02:05,901 --> 02:02:07,708
decision doesn't mean that that

1475
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:12,517
legislation was cited to him. Act was before him.

1476
02:02:12,994 --> 02:02:19,973
he str... Justice Gleeson referred to numerous
pieces of legislation in his decision

1477
02:02:20,071 --> 02:02:22,071
dealing with currency.

1478
02:02:22,432 --> 02:02:27,769
Do you agree with Justice Gleeson's
statement in paragraph 53

1479
02:02:32,432 --> 02:02:39,331
that I would have thought would be
point of interest for the Crown,

1480
02:02:40,907 --> 02:02:46,267
at the sentence the one that mentions Customs
instead of Proceeds, but if you go

1481
02:02:46,934 --> 02:02:53,452
"the denominational or face value of the
non-circulation coins would have to be declared"

1482
02:02:55,400 --> 02:03:01,297
So let's say you had a drug
smuggler and decides to bring back his

1483
02:03:01,938 --> 02:03:08,660
 100,000 and buys $1 bills that are worth ... you'd
be happy that he doesn't have to declare that?

1484
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:15,386
Yes, because he has to declare it as
"goods". It's not money laundering. It's...

1485
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:22,469
if you bring the Flowing Hair dollar coin,
which I refer to in my memorandum,

1486
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:25,223
there's a picture of it at the back
of my book of authorities.

1487
02:03:25,494 --> 02:03:30,034
If you bought that and brought it into Canada,
you would have to declare it as a "good"

1488
02:03:30,412 --> 02:03:33,526
 because you purchased it, well,
the last time it was bought,

1489
02:03:33,525 --> 02:03:35,525
it was bought for 10 million dollars US.

1490
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:41,064
You don't have to declare it under the
Proceeds of Crime and Money Laundering Act

1491
02:03:41,103 --> 02:03:44,743
because the face value is less
than 10,000 dollars Canadian.

1492
02:03:45,073 --> 02:03:50,154
You declare it only as a good.
The Proceeds Act only comes into play

1493
02:03:50,161 --> 02:03:55,139
 if the face value of the money that may
or may not be laundered is over 10,000 dollars.

1494
02:03:57,184 --> 02:04:04,015
And what about if that's right, then
you can put to the bank or in your...

1495
02:04:05,018 --> 02:04:11,879
I'm just I'm just puzzled by the fact that
you don't think that people have to declare.

1496
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:19,112
... the million dollar they bring in
it's just because it's on face value.

1497
02:04:20,093 --> 02:04:25,547
The money laundering provisions of the
Proceeds of Crime Act do not apply

1498
02:04:25,530 --> 02:04:30,592
to collectible coins that have a very low
face value but a very high fair market value.

1499
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:37,287
It's like bringing in diamonds. The Proceeds Act
just doesn't apply in terms of money laundering

1500
02:04:37,288 --> 02:04:43,438
even though a drug smuggler or a terrorist can
bring one diamond in, and it's

1501
02:04:43,573 --> 02:04:47,093
easily over 10,000 dollars. It's different
legislation that applies to catch that.

1502
02:04:47,158 --> 02:04:53,149
The  Act only applies to the
importation of actual currency and only...

1503
02:04:53,559 --> 02:04:59,985
[unintelligible] ... face value
... [unintelligible]

1504
02:05:00,668 --> 02:05:02,297
I would have to check but I believe so.

1505
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:04,785
Why don't you check!

1506
02:05:04,906 --> 02:05:07,291
You mean it's not in our authority

1507
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:09,321
Well, no.

1508
02:05:09,758 --> 02:05:12,868
We have a judgment that is based
on that and we don't have ...

1509
02:05:12,881 --> 02:05:17,017
We have the provision that is at
issue whether but we don't have

1510
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:22,168
we don't have the entire act before
the court in my book of authorities

1511
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:23,986
And yeah, but

1512
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:25,968
we have the specific provision.

1513
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:35,025
So the reporting that... if we look in the Act, and
search "face value", we should

1514
02:05:35,055 --> 02:05:36,756
find a disposition about that

1515
02:05:36,768 --> 02:05:37,875
Of course!

1516
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:39,600
Okay, so I'll... we'll find it.

1517
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:44,411
But it is understood by the Border Service
Officers that they are to go by that,

1518
02:05:44,655 --> 02:05:46,354
 the face value of currency.

1519
02:05:47,137 --> 02:05:49,137
not the fair market value

1520
02:05:51,993 --> 02:05:58,559
... it's conceivable that you could have old
Canadian dollar bills that are worth much more

1521
02:05:58,597 --> 02:06:03,614
than one dollar right now, but still would not be
within the 10,000 dollar limit. Would not be over.

1522
02:06:03,657 --> 02:06:05,657
 They don't have to be declared.

1523
02:06:05,867 --> 02:06:12,645
Because of their face value but if the terrorist
goes to sell it, you know and obtains more than

1524
02:06:12,664 --> 02:06:15,085
10,000 dollars. Obviously. That's a problem.

1525
02:06:15,203 --> 02:06:17,165
so you have no problem with that, ok

1526
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:27,371
So essentially you're saying you ..
[unintelligible] over the judgement in respect

1527
02:06:27,454 --> 02:06:29,454
of the Declaration for "goods" and money

1528
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:33,600
And you rely on your written submission?

1529
02:06:33,819 --> 02:06:34,981
Yes.

1530
02:06:35,596 --> 02:06:42,338
Well look... in terms of the question you asked me
"did the Justice Gleeson consider section 11

1531
02:06:43,210 --> 02:06:45,971
 of the Currency Act" to take one of
my friend's arguments.

1532
02:06:46,541 --> 02:06:53,428
At paragraph 50 of Justice Gleeson's reasons
for decision he devotes almost a pagePer

1533
02:06:53,612 --> 02:07:00,563
 and a half of his reasons for decision to
citing Section 8, for example, of the Customs Act.

1534
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:06,906
I simply want to raise the point again that
he simply because he hasn't specifically

1535
02:07:06,951 --> 02:07:09,689
cited section 11 doesn't mean
he didn't consider it

1536
02:07:09,689 --> 02:07:12,325
Okay, and it's clear that
the argument wasn't important.

1537
02:07:12,333 --> 02:07:13,440
Yes.

1538
02:07:14,595 --> 02:07:17,810
Now, paragraph 65

1539
02:07:20,031 --> 02:07:26,585
Messieur said that contrary to what
was stated by the judge there,

1540
02:07:26,696 --> 02:07:31,245
 he did argue that at paragraph 9 of his
material on page 118 of the motion 

1541
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,071
so is there something wrong in this

1542
02:07:40,528 --> 02:07:42,689
Uhh.. No.

1543
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,504
I don't think I'm following you.

1544
02:07:48,518 --> 02:07:55,025
Paragraph 65 to judge says "the plaintiff has not
argued that the coins, if found to be goods, are

1545
02:07:56,877 --> 02:07:59,756
exempt" The appellant says that's
wrong, he did argue

1546
02:08:00,942 --> 02:08:02,261
Do you know whether that's...

1547
02:08:02,278 --> 02:08:07,182
Oh, I see what your point is. It's not the finding,
 it's whether or not Messieur made... yes.

1548
02:08:07,238 --> 02:08:10,031
Yes, Justice Gleeson is absolutely
accurate on that point.

1549
02:08:10,391 --> 02:08:15,639
I would have to take you to his notice, I'm sorry,
his written representations filed in response

1550
02:08:15,822 --> 02:08:17,822
to the motion for summary judgment.

1551
02:08:18,005 --> 02:08:23,408
So let's look at 118, it says it's on page 118

1552
02:08:25,154 --> 02:08:28,553
Plaintiff reponse to the motion...

1553
02:08:29,702 --> 02:08:36,646
Again, it's a problem with my
book on page 118 is not

1554
02:08:36,657 --> 02:08:40,002
 doesn't have paragraph, it's tab numbers

1555
02:08:40,794 --> 02:08:45,885
At page 118 of the appeal book

1556
02:08:45,946 --> 02:08:50,932
Appeal book, 102-18

1557
02:08:51,344 --> 02:08:57,567
paragraph 9

1558
02:08:58,036 --> 02:09:03,600
I think you're saying it should
be it should be page 121.

1559
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:12,156
Okay,can you look at your book
and it may be one page 1.1

1560
02:09:12,306 --> 02:09:16,548
paragraph 9, it starts with paragraph 24

1561
02:09:22,971 --> 02:09:29,477
Find the paragraph 9 to which you refer and
show it to the registrar officer so we'll find it.

1562
02:09:29,973 --> 02:09:34,745
it is very very difficult to follow
when the books are not organized

1563
02:09:37,085 --> 02:09:41,277
yes, it's on page 121 of our book

1564
02:09:53,969 --> 02:10:00,528
Anyway I think we've got your point,
the point being made that this argument

1565
02:10:00,528 --> 02:10:02,100
was put to the judge

1566
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:04,000
Whether or not the judge accepted as if

1567
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,900
an issue exactly yes. Yes, that's the point

1568
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:12,900
and you don't have nine and tell us if you
think it's the same argument that they've got 65

1569
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:16,400
because maybe it's not the same argument.

1570
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:26,117
Well, the plaintiff has ... admitted.
The evidence is clear

1571
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:32,020
He paid 5700 US for the coins. So clearly that if the
coins are "goods", that would trigger

1572
02:10:32,088 --> 02:10:34,677
the reporting requirements.

1573
02:10:36,205 --> 02:10:42,903
Ok, 65... "the plaintiff has not argued that the
coins, if found to be goods, are exempt from the

1574
02:10:43,112 --> 02:10:47,912
reporting requirement set out in 12(1)"

1575
02:10:48,557 --> 02:10:52,145
12(1) of the Customs act

1576
02:10:54,519 --> 02:11:01,282
So what do we have at 9

1577
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:10,948
But now we're talking about the different Act.
In nine we're talking about the Excise Tax Act

1578
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:25,400
section 12(1) of the Customs Act.

1579
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:31,698
All goods that are imported shall except in such
circumstances  subject that may be prescribed

1580
02:11:31,949 --> 02:11:33,949
be reported to the nearest

1581
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:35,900
So all goods that are imported.

1582
02:11:37,395 --> 02:11:38,600
Yes, so

1583
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:41,341
you're saying that argument?

1584
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:49,156
I'm saying that argument must have been made
to the judge because the plaintiff conceeded

1585
02:11:49,175 --> 02:11:53,724
 that he paid an amount in excess
of the allowable limit not to report

1586
02:11:53,859 --> 02:11:58,391
so maybe the Judge misspoke when
he says the argument has not been made.

1587
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:02,258
It's possible, but I don't see
that anything turns on that

1588
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:07,772
Okay, it's just that we need you to guide us.

1589
02:12:07,781 --> 02:12:08,806
Yes

1590
02:12:08,796 --> 02:12:11,176
You're kinda saying,
"Ok, you [unintelligible] all this"

1591
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:15,855
Fair enough. But Milady, I didn't anticipate that
the plaintiff ws going to take issue with

1592
02:12:15,905 --> 02:12:19,991
 something on this with respect to this
particular sentence in Justice Gleeson's reason

1593
02:12:21,111 --> 02:12:23,073
He didn't make that point in his memorandum.

1594
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:27,100
Okay, so that point is not in the memorandum.

1595
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,922
and it's not

1596
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:33,385
Okay, I don't see anything turning on it.

1597
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:52,218
Okay. The next point was a paragraph 68.

1598
02:12:55,700 --> 02:13:02,257
The reference to the fact that there are
overlapping provisions in itself shows that the

1599
02:13:02,423 --> 02:13:06,911
matter is not sufficiently clear
for the judge to decide.

1600
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:13,894
The Crown disagrees. Just the mere fact that
they're is an overlap does not mean that

1601
02:13:13,963 --> 02:13:18,471
 there's a conflict and what Justice Gleeson did
was review all of the different pieces of relevant

1602
02:13:18,532 --> 02:13:22,859
legislation very clearly and craft together

1603
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:28,400
the clear proposition that goods...
that goods... these collector coins are "goods"

1604
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:34,709
There was no easy answer for him.
There was no definition of money

1605
02:13:34,830 --> 02:13:39,967
 in any of these Acts, but by looking at all of
the piece of legislation, which he has carefully

1606
02:13:40,125 --> 02:13:45,825
 sited at length in his long decision.
He found as a fact that coins are "goods".

1607
02:13:45,999 --> 02:13:48,400
Yeah, that's a matter of law.

1608
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:50,312
Yes.

1609
02:13:55,329 --> 02:14:00,297
There is no issue.. we all know what
"goods" are, there is no disagreement

1610
02:14:00,990 --> 02:14:04,883
Okay, the next point that was raised and

1611
02:14:09,128 --> 02:14:15,847
the Appellant argues that this question alone
was not enough, and the judge had also to consider

1612
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:22,617
whether the decision under appeal was otherwise 

1613
02:14:26,725 --> 02:14:31,959
In fact the only task before the Federal Court on
the motion for summary judgement was to determine

1614
02:14:31,996 --> 02:14:37,043
whether the coins were
"goods" or "currency" or both.

1615
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:43,000
The outcome of that determination was
determinate of the entire statutory appeal.

1616
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:47,600
There was no need to allow any
of the other claims to proceed.

1617
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:51,342
And Justice Gleeson so found.

1618
02:14:51,871 --> 02:14:53,871
Okay, but..

1619
02:14:54,400 --> 02:15:01,141
And the ministerial decision to be clear was not
technically something he judicially reviewed

1620
02:15:01,445 --> 02:15:06,574
This is a statutory appeal by way of action.
So Justice Gleeson technically did not need

1621
02:15:06,817 --> 02:15:09,564
 to consider the ministerial decision beyond

1622
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:10,812
 its actual outcome.

1623
02:15:10,885 --> 02:15:11,926
because it's "de novo"

1624
02:15:11,959 --> 02:15:13,225
yes.

1625
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,025
With different evidence

1626
02:15:16,070 --> 02:15:17,238
Yes.

1627
02:15:19,392 --> 02:15:20,447
Okay.

1628
02:15:35,938 --> 02:15:41,309
We've pretty much conceeded that the

1629
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:48,758
in an action on different part,
the argument about 81.23(a)

1630
02:15:48,881 --> 02:15:55,691
in the Excise Tax Act shows that if you want
to preclude many claims in one you have to say it

1631
02:15:56,553 --> 02:15:57,687
so you're not talking about this

1632
02:15:57,720 --> 02:15:58,420
no,

1633
02:15:58,453 --> 02:15:59,198
okay.

1634
02:16:08,817 --> 02:16:10,863
We do understand that

1635
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:14,500
Whatever the merits you have to go by the rules,

1636
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:15,639
absolutely.

1637
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Okay, I think.

1638
02:16:20,982 --> 02:16:26,541
We're talking when you type of the goods that had to
be reported you say the goods that had to be

1639
02:16:26,609 --> 02:16:30,042
reported were in excess of your exemption

1640
02:16:30,648 --> 02:16:37,900
I thought you said refers to goods in excess
your personal limitation, personal exemption.

1641
02:16:38,371 --> 02:16:43,330
Yes, that's true, but here the
goods were clearly in excess

1642
02:16:43,931 --> 02:16:50,754
yes, it's a matter of law. The only time he has to
report goods is over, I believe it's $800 Canadian

1643
02:16:50,837 --> 02:16:55,085
So if you are out of the country for 7 days,
and bring back $500 worth of goods,

1644
02:16:55,299 --> 02:16:58,139
First you can say to the officer
that "No, I'm not bringing back any"

1645
02:16:58,171 --> 02:17:03,194
Yes... No, that "I am not bringing
back anything that I have to declare"

1646
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:09,406
You have to disclose that he's bought goods,
but they are not subject to the reporting

1647
02:17:09,409 --> 02:17:12,950
requirements under the Customs Act,
or the Proceeds Act.

1648
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:20,395
Let's say instead of buying at $5000,
he bought it at $500

1649
02:17:20,465 --> 02:17:24,970
and his exemption was 800,
he would not have had to declare

1650
02:17:25,098 --> 02:17:26,122
No.

1651
02:17:26,223 --> 02:17:32,315
but I have nothing to declare"

1652
02:17:32,377 --> 02:17:34,377
but I have nothing to declare"

1653
02:17:34,438 --> 02:17:38,153
He could not simply say
"I have not purchased any goods abroad"

1654
02:17:38,278 --> 02:17:41,935
Because of the form that says
"did you bring any goods over the limit"

1655
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:45,640
On the form? Yes, but if you're actually asked
- this was a land crossing -

1656
02:17:45,647 --> 02:17:47,647
if you're asked by the Border Services officers

1657
02:17:47,659 --> 02:17:52,305
 squarely "Have you purchased anything abroad",
technically, you should say

1658
02:17:52,257 --> 02:17:55,463
"I haven't purchased anything over that limit"

1659
02:17:55,630 --> 02:17:57,630
Beyond that...

1660
02:17:57,797 --> 02:18:01,301
When you look at section 12(1), Customs Act,
it seems to suggest that

1661
02:18:01,322 --> 02:18:04,682
"all goods must be reported to the nearest..."

1662
02:18:04,795 --> 02:18:07,943
Only over the s... da... da..
There are exemptions

1663
02:18:07,937 --> 02:18:10,225
That's where you have it in the 

1664
02:18:10,457 --> 02:18:14,316
I will provide those specific sections

1665
02:18:14,372 --> 02:18:16,377
exemptions to section 12

1666
02:18:19,144 --> 02:18:22,816
and we all have those exemptions when we
travel abroad, typically for alcohol

1667
02:18:22,773 --> 02:18:25,141
everybody knows that

1668
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:36,350
So the main provision in fact for the duty to
declare is 12(1), but some exemptions

1669
02:18:37,674 --> 02:18:43,833
and that's regardless of whether or not
you're obliged to pay taxes

1670
02:18:44,786 --> 02:18:51,173
because those exemptions did not apply to the
plaintiff, I did not put them in my authorities

1671
02:18:51,209 --> 02:18:54,360
but I will provide them

1672
02:18:59,355 --> 02:19:02,868
Were you seeking costs

1673
02:19:03,763 --> 02:19:10,536
If my client is successful in this Court, my client
will ask for costs on the appeals, but success

1674
02:19:10,676 --> 02:19:15,651
was divided in the court below, but it would only be
with respect to the appeals, and

1675
02:19:15,807 --> 02:19:19,227
my client would be happy that

1676
02:19:32,791 --> 02:19:45,033
If we were to agree on the question of law, money or goods, but disagree that you could dismiss the whole action.

1677
02:19:45,323 --> 02:19:49,520
Then it will be, you wouldn't be seeking costs.

1678
02:19:49,832 --> 02:19:53,920
I would have to conceed that
success would be divided

1679
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:59,700
And in the first instance, you did say
each party bear their own costs.

1680
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:01,193
Yes.

1681
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:04,200
Success was clearly divided before Justice.

1682
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:07,800
Thank you.

1683
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:15,745
Reply is just about what to say.

1684
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:22,749
However there my friend made quite a few
actually responded but quite a few points.

1685
02:20:22,821 --> 02:20:27,872
I'd like to start with 101 the amendment

1686
02:20:27,886 --> 02:20:39,823
He noted the Teva jurisprudence. Teva was relied
on in Hryniak in order to derive the principles

1687
02:20:41,341 --> 02:20:47,240
under which an amendment
may be struck. Hryniak was

1688
02:20:47,676 --> 02:20:51,604
you can't... this is in your memorandum in chief

1689
02:20:51,818 --> 02:20:55,340
it is in your authorities. That's not a reply

1690
02:20:56,487 --> 02:21:02,816
a reply is something that was new in what he said
otherwise you have to say it all in the first part

1691
02:21:03,025 --> 02:21:05,634
he said that

1692
02:21:05,554 --> 02:21:09,482
Teva gives the judge the authority to strike the

1693
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:11,232
the amendment

1694
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:17,700
to refuse the amendment. Yes, and you've
already told us about the jurisprudence.

1695
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:23,100
Yes, however, Teva would not apply

1696
02:21:26,308 --> 02:21:27,500
why it wouldn't apply

1697
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:33,039
Teva would not apply because it was guidance
for summary judgment motions.

1698
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:35,474
 Not for amendment motions.

1699
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:36,895
Perfect next.

1700
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:46,195
my friend said

1701
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:52,717
That the plaintiff did not alege mistreatment,
which is not correct. One of those specific claims

1702
02:21:52,753 --> 02:21:57,448
 is against officer Debski for threats

1703
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:06,155
threats of violence

1704
02:22:13,475 --> 02:22:20,287
Okay. perfect.

1705
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:39,769
The respondent also made submissions about time limitations for officers or and your Honor made a point about the hurdles.

1706
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:45,900
of having time limitations fortunately, in this case the timers of limitations have not even started

1707
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:50,300
what do you mean

1708
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:52,900
the timers have not started

1709
02:22:53,048 --> 02:23:02,778
the individuals are still expecting this ransom payment for the return of the money. So that means that the

1710
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:06,200
fraud is continuing. It's not a finished transaction.

1711
02:23:07,276 --> 02:23:09,461
ok, so... ok

1712
02:23:09,649 --> 02:23:13,039
that was not the judge didn't determined anything.

1713
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:14,400
No, that was a point. So

1714
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:22,100
you don't need to reply. I'm just I think we were discussing what you need to face later down the road if we return it.

1715
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:51,800
And about the daily section exemptions, there's fun and mix the arc the daily that respond makes the argument that some of the exemptions that come under schedule 3 of the exact Tax Act do apply which are the exemptions with respect to time spent outside the 800 dollars per day.

1716
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:58,048
Yes. Yeah. He's going to give us, but he said that well, if the authoritative...

1717
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:09,400
12 of the Customs Act is the operative provision and that there are some exceptions with respect to time of travel

1718
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:28,374
my point my reply is that the same exemptions or the exemptions that that he refers to come from the same place as the exemption for coin they all come from schedule 3. So the point is if there is an exemption for time spent outside of Canada. 

1719
02:24:28,534 --> 02:24:31,446
This would be equally for all the other

1720
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:40,682
You'll be able to put that in your letter when... that's the part 2 of your letter, remember?

1721
02:24:40,696 --> 02:24:49,524
He is going to give us the regulation and you're gonna have ... so that's going to be easy to reply

1722
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:53,800
very well.

1723
02:24:56,400 --> 02:25:05,019
the respondent also stated that he wouldn't he would be happy that a smuggler would declare a large sum of

1724
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:09,507
gold coins as goods and this

1725
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,921
however, he said

1726
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:26,096
I believe he said that depending on the amount of gold coins, they would have to be reported. However, the drive of the respondent is that no amount

1727
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:28,200
that there is no amount of

1728
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:32,900
no prescribed amount for gold coins

1729
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:36,215
we're just we're not talking about the Custom Act

1730
02:25:38,531 --> 02:25:43,900
Under the Proceeds Act, no amount of gold coins would have to be reported.

1731
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:49,387
No, he said they would have to be if they're over 10,000

1732
02:25:49,356 --> 02:25:56,275
so that's one section and then he didn't say they would have to be reported on the Custom Act

1733
02:25:56,303 --> 02:26:00,976
On the contrary, he said they would have to be reported if purchased.

1734
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:02,500
He contradicts

1735
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:24,600
himself by saying that there is a limit and for the proceeds act.
The CBSA and as shown in the evidence before the judge. There's a memo about precious metals where coins such as these and other financial instruments that are gold bars for example are not to be reported.

1736
02:26:24,668 --> 02:26:34,341
Okay, we cannot exist in the appeal book.

1737
02:26:38,509 --> 02:26:45,104
You are referring to the Precious Metals Bullion and Coin Information Bulletin?

1738
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:45,841
Yes

1739
02:26:45,957 --> 02:26:53,220
So I've got it in the very first...

1740
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:57,873
and what is the contradiction

1741
02:26:57,916 --> 02:27:01,984
The contradiction is that that internal memo, which is a secret document

1742
02:27:02,319 --> 02:27:04,664
says that 

1743
02:27:05,351 --> 02:27:14,044
currency gold and silver precious metals

1744
02:27:17,171 --> 02:27:29,994
but it has to be before the..
You've got it in the appeal book with respect to the amendment, part of the same action

1745
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:32,400
So it's just in a different appeal.

1746
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:33,800
It is in both, Your Honour.

1747
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:41,700
Okay, and that would be too I was actually document. So what is it that you're saying is a contradiction of what he said

1748
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:46,590
so that internal memo instructs CBSA officers

1749
02:27:46,581 --> 02:27:47,081
where

1750
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:57,241
So you let us read this and it's contrary to what he is saying, is that what you're saying?

1751
02:28:11,726 --> 02:28:19,400
your page 100 of the appeal book, which is the second page of the memo.

1752
02:28:22,871 --> 02:28:26,271
second page of the memo

1753
02:28:26,727 --> 02:28:30,103
not in our book, but second page of the memo, yeah

1754
02:28:30,156 --> 02:28:34,941
the second page of the memo, under tariff classification

1755
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:42,200
coins are also to be treated as goods and not as currency and the word "not' is underlined

1756
02:28:43,246 --> 02:28:49,425
The last sentence of that of that paragraph says "across border currency and monetary instrument report", which is formed

1757
02:28:49,523 --> 02:28:57,257
But I don't see how ... this is a tariff classification, what does that have to do with the proceeds

1758
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:09,127
Because it instructs the last sentence instructs officers. "Do not require reporting under the monetary instrument regulations."

1759
02:29:09,165 --> 02:29:14,451
a cross border currency monetary report is not required

1760
02:29:14,616 --> 02:29:17,985
to be filed by the importer at this time

1761
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:21,586
and that is without regard to the amount.

1762
02:29:34,642 --> 02:29:40,086
This document you got ... in discovery?

1763
02:29:49,537 --> 02:30:07,000
So I would give one minute after you're done for an answer from the other side because normally these things that are already raised by you have to be raised all in the first time around.

1764
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,900
I'm sorry, that's high pressure that I would like under.

1765
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:14,600
Yes. Pretty good. Okay. So with the next Point

1766
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:18,604
next point that the Respondent makes is that

1767
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:34,497
that declaring financial instruments and gold currency under the Customs Act would be sufficient reporting. Even if the amount is large such as terrorist or smuggler. The problem is that the

1768
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:54,382
The two reporting regimes address different needs. The Proceeds Act reports go to the FINTRAC organization, which is able to track and find patterns and financial movement. Whereas Customs Act reports only go to Industry Canada tabulations to find out generally how our economy is doing

1769
02:30:54,706 --> 02:31:00,993
So a report pursuant Customs Act would be would go under the radar of the FINTRAC

1770
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:04,361
And they will not be able to

1771
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:08,024
To find ...

1772
02:31:08,008 --> 02:31:14,507
But it has really not much application to your case

1773
02:31:15,239 --> 02:31:16,600
Your case,

1774
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:20,500
I believe I believe this is exactly what the CBSA is trying to do

1775
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:22,700
No, because you're under 10,000.

1776
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,200
It doesn't apply to my case

1777
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,400
No, it's what I'm saying.

1778
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:29,600
It doesn't apply to my four coins, but my claim that is

1779
02:31:42,227 --> 02:31:43,604
next point.

1780
02:31:50,083 --> 02:31:53,500
No, he said that you made the argument

1781
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:59,999
so the judge knew about it, he just didn't feel that it was necessary to write it in his reasons

1782
02:32:00,040 --> 02:32:10,246
my reply is that section 11 would have been determinative, and his conclusion would have been different

1783
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:17,500
About the conflict.

1784
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:21,539
Where judge Gleeson

1785
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:29,500
the respondent says that there isn't an actual conflict. However it paragraph 72 of the decision judge Gleeson says there's no real conflict.

1786
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:34,400
And that implies that there is a conflict is just not to be seen as real.

1787
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:35,323
Yeah.

1788
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:56,500
Your Honour with respect to the de novo treatment of the of the case, the de novo treatment applies to the action as a whole which means that every every claim in the action has to be considered de novo.

1789
02:32:57,100 --> 02:32:57,800
It doesn't mean that

1790
02:32:57,846 --> 02:33:04,951
the rest of the action was never...
It's the first time. De novo - first time

1791
02:33:04,984 --> 02:33:07,000
Yes. However, it doesn't mean that the

1792
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:29,495
The appeal is respect to section 135 needs to be determined de novo and even if it did if the judge had a lot of 135 from the beginning there was no evidence before him whatsoever of any contravention? There was no evidence of what was or was not important.

1793
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:31,604
next

1794
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:43,600
there's all I have on

1795
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:49,085
and am I correct that it was not disputed that you did not declare those coins

1796
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:49,999
Correct

1797
02:33:50,538 --> 02:33:53,478
It's not descriptive that they were coins.

1798
02:33:53,773 --> 02:33:59,758
What they were, what their face value was and what their purchase value was.

1799
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:15,348
In the narative report of officer Debski, which is the officer that did the search and the finding that he noted at the very end that he understands that the coins are technically currency, but

1800
02:34:16,179 --> 02:34:23,665
he needs to treat him as "goods" because of this memo. That instructed him.

1801
02:34:25,341 --> 02:34:33,106
I want to commend you on your knowledge of your file and the judgement and everything, you've done extremely well

1802
02:34:35,862 --> 02:34:39,076
do you have anything to say about the costs?

1803
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:44,608
I would like yes, I do. Of course. Yes.

1804
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:52,164
You're not a lawyer, so you can't get costs except disbursments and things like that

1805
02:34:52,600 --> 02:35:07,163
Well Your Honor in the motion to strike at the responded mate earlier in the case, Prothonotary Milczynski found that even though I'm not a lawyer, I'm still entitled to time.

1806
02:35:07,515 --> 02:35:11,565
Ok, but do you want an ammount?

1807
02:35:11,829 --> 02:35:13,585
It's difficult ...

1808
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:40,000
Make the submission together with the others? I need to check my paperwork.

1809
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:45,310
and when you do that you have to put evidence so the other side can

1810
02:35:45,900 --> 02:35:47,193
respond

1811
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:12,547
very heavy-handed and vexatious. I like to point out that

1812
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:19,100
before you do this things the judge didn't find anything vexatious or anything.

1813
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:21,900
No, I'm making point about costs on the appeal.

1814
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:25,600
Yes, but we haven't seen anything that says before

1815
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:33,896
I would like to submit the letter that the respondent submitted to the registry with respect to the appellants submission of

1816
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:43,552
of the memoranda. He lied in the letter to the registry claiming that the service was done improperly.

1817
02:36:43,871 --> 02:36:52,929
So far in this case the Respondent has fight in every way possible to slow down and to make it more expensive to

1818
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:07,589
it's already in the registry in the file, so we don't need to fi..., but there is no ... whether it was right or not...

1819
02:37:08,050 --> 02:37:17,375
We'll consider your appeal, but it takes a lot to say that ... fraudulent or vexatious...

1820
02:37:17,374 --> 02:37:19,374
If you allow me the time to explain

1821
02:37:19,374 --> 02:37:21,000
No.. no more time.

1822
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,100
You didn't ask for it in your memorandum

1823
02:37:24,544 --> 02:37:26,700
in my memorandum

1824
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:34,900
that's supposed to include everything about costs

1825
02:37:47,985 --> 02:37:52,602
In that case, I suppose normal costs

1826
02:37:54,307 --> 02:38:03,159
You will put your disbursment and the time you spent in the letter, and we'll be able to answer

1827
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:04,900
Now thank you very much

1828
02:38:04,900 --> 02:38:14,185
I'll give you a minute to answer the page of bulletin that Cross Border Report is not required.

1829
02:38:14,346 --> 02:38:27,491
Sure. That bulletin predated Justice Gleeson's ruling. It was obtained during the discovery process prior to the summary judgement motion, so obviously that bulletin would have to be updated with respect to the treatment of currency.

1830
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,297
Was it before the judge or not?

1831
02:38:30,349 --> 02:38:31,589
I don't believe so.

1832
02:38:31,727 --> 02:38:33,500
Okay, so if it not before the judge

1833
02:38:33,703 --> 02:38:37,499
Why would it be in the appeal book?

1834
02:38:37,736 --> 02:38:49,952
 Because, well because appellant has put several documents that were in avail... produced in discovery into the book

1835
02:38:49,969 --> 02:38:54,311
You're supposed to object to that. He's not supposed to add things which were not before the judge.

1836
02:38:54,700 --> 02:38:57,971
yes, milady he...

1837
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:15,988
I did ask for a specific ruling that we'd be allowed to file separate books of authorities just as an example and that was granted. It was Justice Renny. There's a history in this file of not being able to agree on what documents should go into which books

1838
02:39:15,942 --> 02:39:26,924
So on the question of that bulletin you're saying was not before Justice Gleeson when he was making the decision on amending the Statement of Claim

1839
02:39:26,867 --> 02:39:31,095
because that whole bulletin, I think, is part of the reason why he wanted

1840
02:39:31,095 --> 02:39:31,895
Yes

1841
02:39:31,895 --> 02:39:36,071
So do you know for sure whether or not the judge had that in front of him?

1842
02:39:36,051 --> 02:39:42,067
It wasn't part of the evidence that the plaintiff submitted for his motion to Amendment the Claim.

1843
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:58,986
To the extent that the bulletin

1844
02:39:59,638 --> 02:40:02,083
Is it part of the evidence?

1845
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:05,800
That would have been an affidavit for the motion to strike.

1846
02:40:06,253 --> 02:40:16,391
That's not the same.
What we're looking at is what was on the record for the summary judgment motion and the motion to amend

1847
02:40:16,385 --> 02:40:19,300
They were different affidavits filed for both.

1848
02:40:19,300 --> 02:40:21,872
So this would not have been

1849
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:25,230
You know what... you check your files

1850
02:40:25,257 --> 02:40:34,893
Check your files, I want an exact thing on this in your letter, the same letter that you have to write

1851
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:41,500
The point to take away though was that the bulletin would have to be corrected, given Justice Gleeson's ruling on currency.

1852
02:40:42,500 --> 02:40:50,500
Right the whole point here. Is that the bulletin seems to imply that the Border Services officers are not to treat collector coins as currency.

1853
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:56,995
And Justice Gleeson in effect changed the law. He said it's both coins and curency.

1854
02:40:57,058 --> 02:40:57,958
Okay.

1855
02:40:58,099 --> 02:41:02,427
So what you're saying is that...

1856
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:08,024
This may have been an internal administrative... view

1857
02:41:08,121 --> 02:41:08,521
yes.

1858
02:41:09,075 --> 02:41:15,903
but if it's not one that is in sync with the findings of Justice Gleeson

1859
02:41:15,898 --> 02:41:18,700
Yes, and it predates Justice Gleeson's ruling

1860
02:41:18,700 --> 02:41:29,352
And that's why I want to make sure that... and that would be the sentence is in paragraph 53 that we discussed

1861
02:41:29,435 --> 02:41:30,371
Yes.

1862
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:31,590
because

1863
02:41:32,099 --> 02:41:35,458
we may decide not to discuss this matter

1864
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:36,044
of course

1865
02:41:36,036 --> 02:41:37,030
and that

1866
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:47,347
okay, so I understand here.

1867
02:41:47,374 --> 02:41:54,203
Hearing it, whether it was before Justice Gleeson on the two motions that are on appeal before us is very important.

1868
02:41:57,900 --> 02:42:03,870
So thank you very much. We will take this on the reserve. He's

1869
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,002
order

1870
02:42:27,252 --> 02:42:28,934
sitting is now concluded.
