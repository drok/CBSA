Good morning Mr. Peterson,

I have reviewed the remaining answers your client submitted on January
31st. In addition to the comments I made on Feb 2nd, here are the
questions arising from those remaining answers. Please have your client
address them at their earliest convenience, and serve an updated

*Question 5*. The document you provided in response to question 26, as
well as the "legal opinions" and "legislative interpretation" of 1997
that you referred to in answer to question 10, appear to make statements
to the effect that gold and silver coins are not currency. Question 5
asks about _the date_ these two documents were first adopted/approved,
and it asks that the two documents be provided as the answer. Please
provide the two remaining documents, and include an affidavit of
authenticity and genuineness all three, as required by the Canada
Evidence Act.

To be clear, the document "Information Bulletin - Precious Metals -
Bullion and Coin" discloses no author. Kindly state in the affidavit of
authenticity who the author(s) of this document are, and the date it was
first published/approved/issued.

Likewise state the authors for the "legal opinions" and "legislative
interpretation" documents of 1997, as well as the date of first
publication/approval/issuance in the respective authenticity affidavit.

The answer you gave to question 5 on Jan 31st has nothing to do with the
question. The question clearly requests a date ("*when*"), a document
("include *the**document*") and the *references*.

*Question 6*. The point of this question is the _date_ of the first
enforcement, whether it was _challenged in any way_ (eg. Enforcement
Appeal Form), and what was the _final outcome_. (Was the "terms of
release" paid, was the Minister's decision to cancel the enforcement,
was a Federal Court Action initiated, was it settled, etc... ie, how was
the enforcement resolved in the end).

The answer you gave ("the CBSA does not have a specific policy...") does
not answer the question. The other answer, that there was no challenge
in a court of law, does not answer the question "was it challenged (in
any way)".

*Question 7.* The point of this question is not when Mr. Strickland
learnt of the position, but when he stated it himself, or when he
endorsed this position, such as he did in the email to Terry Boudreau,
Lesley McIntosh, and Danielle Lacroix on April 11, 2011. Presumably this
email was in his email inbox since about August 31st, 2010, when Joanne
Lepage responded to the Treasure Island ruling request (possibly he was
blind copied by Joanne). How did Mr. Strickland come to be aware of Ms.
Lepage's August 31st, 2010 email?

Based the Defendant's affidavit of documents, it appears Mr. Strickland
was introduced to the position on August 31st, 2010, or earlier, not in
April 2011 as you stated. Explain if this is not correct.

In any case, once again, the question was not about Mr. Strickland
learning about the position, but about advising others of it (ie, state
or endorse).

*Question 10.* The question was not about Joanne's first learning about
the position, but about the time she first advised others (ie, state or
endorse). One example of her stating it is the email dated August 31st,
2010 to MMeyer@livingstonintl.com regarding "Treasure Island Coins -
CBSA ruling request".

When was the _earliest time_ that Joanne advised anyone else of this
position in the 13 years between 1997 when she was introduced to it, and
August 31st, 2010 when she clearly stated it?

Also please enter into evidence the Legal Opinions and the Legislative
Interpretation of 1997 that you referred to, by attaching the documents
to your reply, together with the respective affidavits of authenticity
and genuineness.

*Question 11*. The CBSA was created on December 12, 2003. Explain how
Joanne was employed with the CBSA since 1990 if the agency was created
13.5 years later? Was she perhaps employed with the Canada Customs and
Revenue Agency prior to 2003? What was her first position and department
within the CBSA? Was Joanne an officer of the CBSA Crown Corporation
(ie, did she have the power to represent the corporation) on August
31st, 2010, or on the date she stated the position referred to in
Question 10?

*Question 14*. I would like to change the question, by changing the
phrase "*Enumerate all* the gold and silver coin types" to "*List any*
gold and silver coin types..."

*Question 22. *Was the online rating provided at BSO Debski's request,
and per his instructions with respect to amounts, goods descriptions and
tariff classification? Were the instructions given after BSO Debski
consulted with the Superintendent and learnt of how the coins are to be
classified, or before? BSO Debski's narrative report states that the
rating was provided as a courtesy. Who was extending this courtesy, if
not BSO Debski? Did anyone else participate in the enforcement action
taken by the CBSA on October 21st, 2014, and any related documentation
created on that date in addition to BSO Debski?

*Question 23.* Is it routine practice for Customs officers to override
the ratings given by the TEPS system, to lower the amount of tax payable
to zero, or does a correction normally happen at a later time, when the
importer submits a B2G form ("CBSA Informal Adjustment Request")? If
overriding is routine practice, why does the rating show a 13% rating
when clearly a 0% rate is more correct?

*Question 24.* The question concerns the tax that would have been
charged on October 21, 2014, _had the coins been reported_ pursuant
Customs Act section 12. If the plaintiff would have declared the coins,
would the CBSA have required a 13% payment representing GST/HST tax,
instead of a 25% payment representing terms of release? (Respecting the
fact that neither officer Debski nor the officer who prepared the online
rating were aware on October 21, 2014 that the coins were tax exempt)

Is it correct that officer Debski was not aware on October 21, 2014 that
the coins were tax exempt (since he assessed a 25% terms of release
rate)? Is it correct that zero-rated goods attract a 5% terms of release
rate, while non-zero-rated goods attract a 25% rate?

Had the enforcement action not been necessary, and the 13% tax been paid
at the time of importation, on October 21, 2014, would it have been
refunded in full if the plaintiff later found out about the
miscalculation and submitted a B2G form ("CBSA Informal Adjustment
Request") ?

*Question 26.* Who is the vendor for the TEPS software, and who is
responsible for providing the specifications on how the TEPS should
operate? How are maintenance requests (bug reports, improvement
requests) made and do they need approval of senior CBSA officers or
legal opinion before they are implemented?

Please provide the bug report or document to that effect that requests
the tax rating classification of precious metals be changed to not apply
GST/HST to them. This bug report is mentioned in the 2nd paragraph of
the first page of the "Infomation Bulletin - Precious Metals - Bullion
and Coin". Include any additional documentation to show when the bug was
filed, the description of the bug, when it was fixed, and which software
release would include the bug fix, and any comments related to this bug.
When did the fixed release enter service?

*Question 36.* The fifth paragraph on the second last page of the Case
Synopsis and Reasons for Decision states the opposite of Mr Dancause's
letter, as to contradict Mr. Dancause, but offers no rebuttal to Mr.
Dancause's representations, which were backed up with underlined
excerpts of the PCMLTFR and Currency Act. The letter is not even
mentioned in the Case Synopsis. *Please explain* how Mr. Dancause's
letter was considered even though it is not even mentioned, without
being quoted, without a trace of any of its contents. After all, every
other piece of correspondence is given a prominent heading in the Case
Synposis in chronological order of its receipt, followed by comments of
the adjudicator.

Seeing how Mr. Dancause's letter was sent only to Ann Kendall, and it
was not mentioned in the Case Synopsis, was Martine Gagnon aware of this
letter when she prepared the Case Synopsis ? Was Mr. Strickland aware of
Mr. Dancause's advice on the issue (seeing how he and Mr. Dancause had
discussed the issue at length, per 1st para of the Dancause letter)?


Please also see below my previous email dated Feb 2nd further questions
arising from your Jan 31st answers.

Kindly re-serve the Answers to Written Examination for Discovery in
affidavit form as required by Federal Court Rule 99(3), along with the
requested documents, with affidavits of authenticity and genuineness.

Sincerely
Radu Hociung.

    <p>Good morning Mr. Peterson,</p>
    <p>I have reviewed the remaining answers your client submitted on
      January 31st. In addition to the comments I made on Feb 2nd, here
      are the questions arising from those remaining answers. Please
      have your client address them at their earliest convenience, and
      serve an updated <br>
    </p>
    <b>Question 5</b>. The document you provided in response to question
    26, as well as the "legal opinions" and "legislative interpretation"
    of 1997 that you referred to in answer to question 10, appear to
    make statements to the effect that gold and silver coins are not
    currency. Question 5 asks about <u>the date</u> these two documents
    were first adopted/approved, and it asks that the two documents be
    provided as the answer. Please provide the two remaining documents,
    and include an affidavit of authenticity and genuineness all three,
    as required by the Canada Evidence Act.<br>
    <br>
    To be clear, the document "Information Bulletin - Precious Metals -
    Bullion and Coin" discloses no author. Kindly state in the affidavit
    of authenticity who the author(s) of this document are, and the date
    it was first published/approved/issued.<br>
    <br>
    Likewise state the authors for the "legal opinions" and "legislative
    interpretation" documents of 1997, as well as the date of first
    publication/approval/issuance in the respective authenticity
    affidavit.<br>
    <br>
    The answer you gave to question 5 on Jan 31st has nothing to do with
    the question. The question clearly requests a date ("<b>when</b>"),
    a document ("include <b>the</b><b> document</b>") and the <b>references</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question 6</b>. The point of this question is the <u>date</u> of
    the first enforcement, whether it was <u>challenged in any way</u>
    (eg. Enforcement Appeal Form), and what was the <u>final outcome</u>.
    (Was the "terms of release" paid, was the Minister's decision to
    cancel the enforcement, was a Federal Court Action initiated, was it
    settled, etc... ie, how was the enforcement resolved in the end).<br>
    <br>
    The answer you gave ("the CBSA does not have a specific policy...")
    does not answer the question. The other answer, that there was no
    challenge in a court of law, does not answer the question "was it
    challenged (in any way)".<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question 7.</b> The point of this question is not when Mr.
    Strickland learnt of the position, but when he stated it himself, or
    when he endorsed this position, such as he did in the email to Terry
    Boudreau, Lesley McIntosh, and Danielle Lacroix on April 11, 2011.
    Presumably this email was in his email inbox since about August
    31st, 2010, when Joanne Lepage responded to the Treasure Island
    ruling request (possibly he was blind copied by Joanne). How did Mr.
    Strickland come to be aware of Ms. Lepage's August 31st, 2010 email?<br>
    <br>
    Based the Defendant's affidavit of documents, it appears Mr.
    Strickland was introduced to the position on August 31st, 2010, or
    earlier, not in April 2011 as you stated. Explain if this is not
    correct.<br>
    <br>
    In any case, once again, the question was not about Mr. Strickland
    learning about the position, but about advising others of it (ie,
    state or endorse).<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question 10.</b> The question was not about Joanne's first
    learning about the position, but about the time she first advised
    others (ie, state or endorse). One example of her stating it is the
    email dated August 31st, 2010 to <a
      class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated"
      href="mailto:MMeyer@livingstonintl.com">MMeyer@livingstonintl.com</a>
    regarding "Treasure Island Coins - CBSA ruling request".<br>
    <br>
    When was the <u>earliest time</u> that Joanne advised anyone else
    of this position in the 13 years between 1997 when she was
    introduced to it, and August 31st, 2010 when she clearly stated it?<br>
    <br>
    Also please enter into evidence the Legal Opinions and the
    Legislative Interpretation of 1997 that you referred to, by
    attaching the documents to your reply, together with the respective
    affidavits of authenticity and genuineness.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question 11</b>. The CBSA was created on December 12, 2003.
    Explain how Joanne was employed with the CBSA since 1990 if the
    agency was created 13.5 years later? Was she perhaps employed with
    the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency prior to 2003? What was her
    first position and department within the CBSA? Was Joanne an officer
    of the CBSA Crown Corporation (ie, did she have the power to
    represent the corporation) on August 31st, 2010, or on the date she
    stated the position referred to in Question 10?<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question 14</b>. I would like to change the question, by changing
    the phrase "<b>Enumerate all</b> the gold and silver coin types" to
    "<b>List any</b> gold and silver coin types..."<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question 22. </b>Was the online rating provided at BSO Debski's
    request, and per his instructions with respect to amounts, goods
    descriptions and tariff classification? Were the instructions given
    after BSO Debski consulted with the Superintendent and learnt of how
    the coins are to be classified, or before? BSO Debski's narrative
    report states that the rating was provided as a courtesy. Who was
    extending this courtesy, if not BSO Debski? Did anyone else
    participate in the enforcement action taken by the CBSA on October
    21st, 2014, and any related documentation created on that date in
    addition to BSO Debski?<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question 23.</b> Is it routine practice for Customs officers to
    override the ratings given by the TEPS system, to lower the amount
    of tax payable to zero, or does a correction normally happen at a
    later time, when the importer submits a B2G form ("CBSA Informal
    Adjustment Request")? If overriding is routine practice, why does
    the rating show a 13% rating when clearly a 0% rate is more correct?<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question 24.</b> The question concerns the tax that would have
    been charged on October 21, 2014, <u>had the coins been reported</u>
    pursuant Customs Act section 12. If the plaintiff would have
    declared the coins, would the CBSA have required a 13% payment
    representing GST/HST tax, instead of a 25% payment representing
    terms of release? (Respecting the fact that neither officer Debski
    nor the officer who prepared the online rating were aware on October
    21, 2014 that the coins were tax exempt)<br>
    <br>
    Is it correct that officer Debski was not aware on October 21, 2014
    that the coins were tax exempt (since he assessed a 25% terms of
    release rate)? Is it correct that zero-rated goods attract a 5%
    terms of release rate, while non-zero-rated goods attract a 25%
    rate?<br>
    <br>
    Had the enforcement action not been necessary, and the 13% tax been
    paid at the time of importation, on October 21, 2014, would it have
    been refunded in full if the plaintiff later found out about the
    miscalculation and submitted a B2G form ("CBSA Informal Adjustment
    Request") ?<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question 26.</b> Who is the vendor for the TEPS software, and who
    is responsible for providing the specifications on how the TEPS
    should operate? How are maintenance requests (bug reports,
    improvement requests) made and do they need approval of senior CBSA
    officers or legal opinion before they are implemented?<br>
    <br>
    Please provide the bug report or document to that effect that
    requests the tax rating classification of precious metals be changed
    to not apply GST/HST to them. This bug report is mentioned in the
    2nd paragraph of the first page of the "Infomation Bulletin -
    Precious Metals - Bullion and Coin". Include any additional
    documentation to show when the bug was filed, the description of the
    bug, when it was fixed, and which software release would include the
    bug fix, and any comments related to this bug. When did the fixed
    release enter service?<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question 36.</b> The fifth paragraph on the second last page of
    the Case Synopsis and Reasons for Decision states the opposite of Mr
    Dancause's letter, as to contradict Mr. Dancause, but offers no
    rebuttal to Mr. Dancause's representations, which were backed up
    with underlined excerpts of the PCMLTFR and Currency Act. The letter
    is not even mentioned in the Case Synopsis. <b>Please explain</b>
    how Mr. Dancause's letter was considered even though it is not even
    mentioned, without being quoted, without a trace of any of its
    contents. After all, every other piece of correspondence is given a
    prominent heading in the Case Synposis in chronological order of its
    receipt, followed by comments of the adjudicator.<br>
    <br>
    Seeing how Mr. Dancause's letter was sent only to Ann Kendall, and
    it was not mentioned in the Case Synopsis, was Martine Gagnon aware
    of this letter when she prepared the Case Synopsis ? Was Mr.
    Strickland aware of Mr. Dancause's advice on the issue (seeing how

      <p>Good morning Mr. Peterson,<br>
        <br>
        Thank you for your fax dated January 31st, 2017, containing
        partial answers to the Written Examination for Discovery served
        to you on July 19, 2016.<br>

      <h3>Objections</h3>
      I would like to point out to you that while your client is indeed
      permitted to make the objections listed under Rule 242 of the
      Federal Court Rules, the objections must be made in the form
      prescribed by Rules 94 (1), (2), 95 (1), (2) with respect to
      documents, and 99 (2) with respect to questions, that is to say
      your client must bring a motion to be relieved from the
      requirement to produce the documents, and to have the question
      struck out, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      An objection is not an answer, but rather a non-answer, and as
      such the answer affidavit you served does not answer the questions
      your client was asked, and thus your client's obligation to
      provide provide written answers by 31-JAN-2017 was not fulfilled.
      Thus once again, your client finds itself at risk of default
      judgment, respecting Rule 97, and separately Rule 210(1).<br>
      <br>
      If questions could be arbitrarily answered with "Objection",
      without the examining party having the opportunity to defend, all
      questions would be answered as such by the adverse party, and the
      entire process of Examination for Discovery would be an exercise
      in futility.<br>
      <br>
      I would like to point out, that while in case of Rule 210, a
      motion for default judgment may be brought by the plaintiff at his
      own discretion, Rule 97 is not so kind. In that case, a motion by
      the plaintiff is not necessary, and it is the Court that decides
      at its own discretion whether to order your client to answer of to
      give default judgment.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Regarding answers to questions<br>
      </h3>
      You may have noticed that I love handling your motions, including
      getting paid for it. Nevertheless, I would like to make some
      further comments, hoping to avoid further waste of time and
      expense:<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the answers your client wishes to object to; Rule
      95 gives your client the opportunity to avoid the expense
      associated with the motion by stating the objection and providing
      a preliminary answer, and having the propriety of the question
      determined at trial. It appears your client has missed this
      opportunity.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to <b>questions 39 and 40</b>, where your client
      asserted solicitor-client privilege; your client has already
      disclosed the summary and content of these communications in
      letters to me dated March 9, 2015 and the Decision rendered on
      June 1, 2015, and thus, they are no longer covered by the
      requirement of being made in confidence, and therefore your client
      has lost privilege. In other words, express waiver of privilege
      occurs where the client voluntarily and intentionally discloses
      confidential communication, as has happened in your client's
      letters to me.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to <b>question 35</b>, the author of the memo is not
      privileged information, it is metadata. Furthermore, the way this
      document is identified in your client's affidavit of documents is
      ambiguous. M. Lefebre may have received multiple memos on Feb 12,
      2015.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the questions to which your client wishes to make
      a relevance objection, it should be clear from the Statement of
      Claim why they are relevant. For this reason, I will not explain
      them further here, but kindly make your motions, and I will be
      happy to elaborate in my (paid) reply.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the Informational Bulletin (<b>question 26</b>).
      The document requested is evidence, and as such it must be
      admissible as required by the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>. Ie, you
      should provide an original or certified copy, and include a
      affidavit of authenticity and genuineness. Furthermore, on the
      date this document was used for enforcement, the document's
      author, Julia Cossitt, had been retired for more than a year. Who
      is the person that assumed authorship, ownership, and continued
      maintenance of this document following Mrs. Cossitt's retirement?<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Questions arising from your client's answers</h3>
      With respect to question 19, the following question arises from
      your client's answer:<br>
      <br>
      <blockquote><b>Clarification of the question: During the
          interaction with the Plaintiff, officer Debski explained
          verbally that "serious offence" means a penalty of arrest. His
          words were "this is an arrestable offence". Why did officer
          Debski not report his "arrestable offense" in his narrative
          report, despite using this phrase three times during the
          interaction?</b><br>
      </blockquote>
      <b><br>
        <br>
      </b><br>
      With respect to question 6, the following question arises from
      your client's answer:<br>
      <br>
      <blockquote><b>Clarification of the question: The question
          requested the date of the first enforcement/seizure of gold or
          silver coins pursuant to the CBSA's position or the Customs
          Act, whether this was challenged in any form (for instance by
          submitting an Enforcement Appeal Form), and what the outcome
          of that challenge/appeal was. The question is not limited to
          challenges in a court of law, which are public information.</b><br>
      </blockquote>
      <br>
      <h3>Closing</h3>
      I would like to hereby give your client the opportunity to revise
      their answers, and completely answer all the questions, and thus
      avoid paying me once more to for handling your motions of
      objection. Or, enter your motions and put a smile on my pretty
      face.<br>
      <br>
      Either way, you should handle this matter before the next CMC, or
      risk default judgment at the discretion of the Court. As much as I
      would love to bring your client to an epic trial rather than bring
      motions pursuant Rule 210, there is nothing I can do to avoid the
      Court's wrath pursuant Rule 97.<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, I full-heartedly recommend you review the Rules of the
      Federal Court at your earliest convenience.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Sincerely,<br>
      Radu Hociung.<br>
