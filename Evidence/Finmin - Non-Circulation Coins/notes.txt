The Canada Gazette Publication Order, which came into force April 1, 2003, gave official status to the electronic PDF version of the Canada Gazette. This status applies to all issues posted in PDF format on the Canada Gazette Web site subsequent to that date. Therefore, all printed versions of the Canada Gazette published from October 2, 1841 up to March 3l, 2014, and PDF versions published since April 1, 2003, are admissible as evidence in court. No PDF issues published prior to April 1, 2003, are considered official versions.
