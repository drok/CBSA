1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,900
order

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:32,000
The special sitting of the federal court of appeal is now open the Honourable Justice Gauthier, The Honorable Mr. Justice Webb, and the Honourable Madam Justice Rivoalen are presiding.
The court calls found numbers A-101-18 and A-102-18.
Radu Hociung and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.
The Appellant will be representing himself and Mr. Peterson will be representing the Respondent.

3
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:56,774
I think I saw you in the room yesterday, so you know how we proceed.
It's your appeal, and you can rest assured that we have read the material,
so you can start with your representations.

4
00:00:56,992 --> 00:00:59,941
Good morning.

5
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:11,300
First the question. What is the meaning of spending is that?

6
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:23,300
Is a request for the court to consider a decision of a lower court or another Authority in decision-making capacity.

7
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,500
Is that about correct

8
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000
in this particular case yesterday it was?

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:49,700
Now this is a motion. Okay, and I'm emotion from a trial court. We applied the standard of review that means our judge whether we can intervene for not according to a case called thousand.

10
00:01:50,500 --> 00:02:01,200
If it is a question of love, we apply the correctness we see if it's correct. And if it is an exactly know or things like that, which normally is

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:18,400
a question of summary judgment is normally exactly know maybe not in this case. It's it's palpable and overriding are and that's a very I stand we have to become there was no records whatsoever to ground.

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,500
the findings

13
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,100
Of course my question

14
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,400
okay with you understand it like I

15
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:47,300
do my question was more General someone more General. It was directed to the word appeal not necessarily in this course. Yeah, because it is referred. For example in the federal court the case before us has to do with the Customs that where there's a word there that says a decision of the minister may be appealed in a federal court.

16
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes, but you have to be careful.

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,500
with one understands of the word appeal in a statue

18
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:06,400
does not always mean the same thing the Supreme Court told us that in several statue the word appeal means almost so it's like

19
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,200
It's a difficult. But in this case why is relevant to your cakes because what is before us?

20
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,700
Is the decision of Justice?

21
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes, the decision was just English.

22
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,700
No, don't worry. I mean this is

23
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:51,900
they don't be relaxed the first the first Essence started as an appeal of a decision of the minister of Public Safety under one person's mind section 135 the language in the Customs Act was

24
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:05,600
that the decision is appealed to the medical. So my question is what does the word appeal mean in such a setting does it not mean? I'm requesting the court to have a look at The Minister's decision. Yes.

25
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,700
But I'm not sure that this is really all that relevant to what is important.

26
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,800
It will be.

27
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,699
Okay. So you explain that to us.

28
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:27,634
My understanding is that it is...

29
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,600
That is... it's not a procedural. It's not a procedural rule.

30
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,303
It is a piece of evidence is evidence of the truth against which the court measures.

31
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,200
Um,

32
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,300
that's an Act of Parliament

33
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,600
it is... that's correct. But what is it to you? Is it evidence? Is it rules? Is it procedural?

34
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,207
It's law.

35
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:58,421
It's the law.

36
00:04:58,429 --> 00:04:59,435
it's the measuring stick.

37
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:00,497
Yes.

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,168
so an Act of Parliament...

39
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,164
Set out what the truth is.

40
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:13,735
The truth has nothing to do with the law. The law is the law and the truth relates to evidence.

41
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:15,603
All right.

42
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:21,185
So when you are asked to take an Act of Parliament under judicial review

43
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,503
Does that not mean that

44
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:41,591
we're not taking an act of parliament under judicial review not under 135 we're looking at the whether or not there is a contraction that's a factual and legal question. If there was a contravention under the Customs Act. We're not discussing the validity of the Customs Act.

45
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:48,728
My wording was was was poor. What I meant to say is when you take

46
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:56,400
an Act of Parliament under judicial notice according to the Canada Evidence Act

47
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,491
The Court has to take Acts of Parliament as judicial notice.

48
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,621
Does not mean that you

49
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:11,200
okay, where are they? Just we have two hours. Okay, three hours for your two files.

50
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:20,546
It's nice if you want to raise all kinds of preliminary questions, but you will have to get to the meat that's what we have to decide.

51
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:23,542
very well. I will skip this one.

52
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,664
Very important question for me. They original.. The first instance...

53
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,869
was in Federal Court and it was quite substantial substantially in terms of evidence provided. The appeal book

54
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,459
for the motion

55
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,400
for amendment for summary judgment was substantial.

56
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:48,382
700 pages

57
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:50,105
my question to you is

58
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:59,472
given that my presentation today is... aims to succeed at convincing you that there was an overriding error and that you have to intervene.

59
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,554
What extent am I required to prove the fact of the

60
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,772
orginal motion

61
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,145
Um, in other words,

62
00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:14,334
The only thing that is before us are the two Appeals.

63
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
Okay, the two appeal books.

64
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,100
For me it feels because one has several so that's what before us.

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:37,933
I don't know yet how you want to proceed. So if you were to proceed then I would be helping you by saying "do you have evidence". We can't talk to that in the air.

66
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:47,311
Of course. My question is in case I convinced you that that your intervention is required.

67
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,900
What what this case be returned back to the federal court for the determination. Would you determine the facts? Where would I ...

68
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,100
We don't determine facts.

69
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,800
So would it go back to the Federal Court then?

70
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,525
It depends on what basis we intervene.

71
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,662
We can't make findings of fact.

72
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:15,819
So if all the facts don't need to be determined and it's a pure question of law, we can decide it.

73
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:19,800
It's not that if there's a reassessment of the evidence.

74
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,038
Then we send it back.

75
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:35,753
All right, very good. Perfect. That answers to my first trip. My last one is I noticed that the deficiency of my book of authority of authorities for the A-101 case, which is the amendment,

76
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,442
I noticed that I entered the wrong

77
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:46,940
Section of the Trial Court Rules; I would like to submit...
I don't have a book of authorities in more than one

78
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:57,604
That's the Respondent's

79
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:04,755
ah, this thing... ok... and what is it that is deficient? Do you want to add something, is that it?

80
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:12,096
The Federal Court Rules I have I had quoted... I meant to include Rule 76.

81
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,032
And 200 which are relevant to amendments.

82
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,300
Ok but don't worry. We know the rules, we will find it.

83
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:20,692
All right. Very well.

84
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,950
So that ... I appreciate your time and patience and [unintelligible]

85
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,979
I'd like to start with 101, which is the amendment motion. I will be

86
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:40,909
in a few words to presenting the the reason

87
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,370
why amendments are necessary why amendments are done at all?

88
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:48,400
And how they fit with the rest of the preceding.

89
00:09:50,200 --> 00:10:12,998
What's their purpose and meaning. Then I will describe the overriding and palpable errors that the Motion Judge made and after this I will close by.

90
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,600
By showing why you should intervene and change the

91
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,655
decision

92
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:33,948
Now... you have an hour and a half for the two appeals...
How are you... I don't know how much time you need

93
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,700
What was the... I just want you to have at

94
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,164
least ten minutes on each, or ten minutes to reply

95
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:45,900
Yes, my original time was much more than that,
I had to scale it down

96
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,319
by a lot.

97
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,024
So how much time do you think the two

98
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,900
Presentation

99
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,800
For both of two I think I will need the entire time I may even go over time.

100
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,045
We won't go over time. We don't go over time.

101
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,044
I may not be able to finish.

102
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,800
in the

103
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,400
in

104
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:15,442
Ok, what I would suggest to you. Okay, and you decide what you want to do, but I was suggest to you that as a court of appeal. We know very well

105
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,698
what is the meaning of an amendment and the rules has to do it?

106
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,900
If I were you, I would really dig immediately into why there's an error.

107
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:29,624
because seriously

108
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,384
You can trust us. We know the rules about amendments. Okay?

109
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,500
That's where you'll have more time. Yes.

110
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:48,453
However, I would like to very very briefly talk about the meaning.
Honorable Court, in a

111
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,104
ordinary action the purpose of the amendments to the pleadings are to set the

112
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:19,348
agenda for for the proceding, that is to inform both the defendant and of course as to what the issues and questions are such that there are no surprise is to either party and such that their the defendants rights are protected such that they can prepare for for the eventual trial.

113
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:31,845
Um, according to the Federal Court Rules amendments can be made at various stages of the proceeding with or without legal of the Court.

114
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,396
As before the defendent even submits a reply.

115
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,600
An amendment can be made without without even

116
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,841
Are we agreeing that in this case the statement of Defense had been

117
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,600
Yes,

118
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,800
so that's a that's a reply. So that means you need the leave of the Court,

119
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,700
correct?

120
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,100
Okay, so let's get on with

121
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,100
My point is that even after that the defense is is entered.

122
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,209
Their the parties can still consent.

123
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,384
No, you need leave of the Court.

124
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,847
The Court will consider

125
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,200
If there is a consent, but it's still the court that decides

126
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:28,050
All right, wery well. I will then skip to the palpable errors.
So, on the motion for amendment, the Motion Judge

127
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:36,100
the most visible palpable error is that he considered evidence in deciding the motion which is something that

128
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:46,500
he is not permitted to consider according with the Federal Court Rules, and also according to the Ontario civil procedure.

129
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:57,133
Okay, why don't you turn to the rules which rules says that he doesn't have the right to look at that and

130
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:16,693
Your Honour, based on precedent of Bauer

131
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:19,067
... that would be in my

132
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,004
Authorities

133
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:37,200
That's in 101, and which case

134
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,991
Fisher.

135
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
23

136
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,900
I don't have pages and that's what I'm

137
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
it would be at the bottom of the page, bottom line.

138
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,745
Yes, but page 23 for me is a Tax Excise

139
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,600
the Excise Tax Act

140
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,300
the latest Authority book

141
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,500
Yeah.

142
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:23,279
So book of authorities 101, page 23 for me is Excise Tax

143
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,311
My friend has a book.

144
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,900
has the same book with different pages.

145
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:45,033
Okay Bauer, ok..

146
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:59,607
I don't have the same index in my as my colleague

147
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,300
So you have the same one. You don't have the Bauer?

148
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay. Okay. I don't know why

149
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm saying one may see it.

150
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,500
Yes.

151
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,700
This is one of two

152
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,300
your friend to 102

153
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,400
know. This is the book for 102.

154
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,300
But you said you were dealing with 101.

155
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm dealing with 101, but somehow the printing.

156
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,700
They must have fallen the the front pages.

157
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:37,800
The covers.

158
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,700
Okay.

159
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,200
No problem.

160
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,300
You're referring to the decision.

161
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,600
Which paragraph

162
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,500
paragraph 16?

163
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,300
Stinky. Yes.

164
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:08,300
When determining whether amendment should be allowed to the judge [unintelligible] matter would capable of getting

165
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,800
instructions

166
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:15,700
the test for being struck in the Fiddle Court Rules.

167
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,300
in 2121

168
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,000
But there are several paragraphs.

169
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:33,400
And only the paragraph no reasonable cause of action. You don't look at evidence all the other paragraph you look at it.

170
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:41,700
Yes

171
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,700
generous, correct.

172
00:17:45,700 --> 00:18:02,800
So if the church things that there's no chance of success or taxation or and that's the another paragraph that you want one where is entitled to look at it?

173
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:18,200
Yes. However in those in this case those were not considered for those other points the church didn't look what was immaterial or redundant material. He didn't look at whether there was candles. He was no language like that in his decision.

174
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,400
Oh, okay. Let's look at the decision.

175
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:38,300
is order

176
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,200
Yes, power

177
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
power antenna.

178
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes, so that's the same case you refer to

179
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
yes.

180
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,700
And the proposed extending that came to not demonstrate their reasonable chance of success.

181
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
I guess you're under the test for

182
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,600
for emotions to amend is

183
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:08,900
I was

184
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I think most authoritatively rested by the federal court by the Supreme Court and Imperial tobacco.

185
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,100
Yes,

186
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,600
which is records by these other cases.

187
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,400
Yes.

188
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800
very little case is that

189
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,200
page

190
00:19:50,700 --> 00:20:03,600
So yeah, but that was also that 22 a 2.18 it was the there was no reasonable cause of action so there he don't look at evidence.

191
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
well, perhaps it would then be

192
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:23,300
helpful for me to look at why MMS are necessary what their life cycle is why why and when evidence should not considered in a case that emotion to amend would be

193
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:33,600
Dismissed that is the client will be blocked from being heard. The plaintiff can always submit.

194
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,200
That many men as a new option.

195
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:52,100
As a new statement of Clans to pursue the same dispute because just by blocking the amendment does not result. It is just so the plaintiff would then

196
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,600
get it as a new action.

197
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,500
based on the same material thoughts

198
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,300
It's always because

199
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,900
you say if he doesn't allow the amendments.

200
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,300
Their claim as it was is still before the court. Is that what you

201
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,800
said is, correct?

202
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Okay. So the same before the court is still and that brings us to the second appeal.

203
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,700
Because you see these things are very much linked.

204
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:26,700
Yeah.

205
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,900
But the Amendments the proposed amendments are are left in the air. They're not

206
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,100
having discarded.

207
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:59,200
Allow them you're saying that they still exist in that there's still a cause of action.

208
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,700
That's available to you.

209
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,400
There's something adding to something that goes over there.

210
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,700
Well, you are one of the Amendments doesn't produce any costs about

211
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,500
which one

212
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,800
that is the one that

213
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
All right proposed on them.

214
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,200
You're adding two defendants.

215
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,400
I might put a defenders in their capacity as a crowned as agents of the crown.

216
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:49,200
Okay, 25 just by I'm looking now at the age of 48 Bill booking.

217
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,500
That is Amanda the underlying

218
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,100
yes,

219
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,600
which one has the new Car Connection?

220
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,900
The claim is that the CBS history commits under 16th South America RC. The CBC is circulates the internal operations. Thank you.

221
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,100
and

222
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,000
61

223
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,200
so that's

224
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,000
60 16 C is on page 60

225
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
page. Yes, 16 C is on page 161

226
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
I have a home page

227
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,900
660.

228
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,400
Is that the cbsa?

229
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,000
For me, it's page 60.

230
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,100
So I don't know why but okay. So that's the important thing. We have the right pair. So you're saying this is a new cause an action

231
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,900
it alleges that they

232
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,000
say is involved in Monday.

233
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,200
but that's not it's just

234
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:35,700
Isn't it just a remedy? Because you've already said that you thought that you was

235
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,200
enabling

236
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:53,900
I just had not mentioned money laundering if you are my longer is a new cause of action in the Amendments before that in the original statement of

237
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,800
Planting my head suspected that it was something that's

238
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,100
good. So what else is a new cause

239
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,600
and there's a lot

240
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,300
of underlining.

241
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,100
Yes, but most of this is really.

242
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:23,500
All related you see you cannot come to 16 and plain unless you've had allegation in the first part.

243
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,600
So there are allegations that are linked to these.

244
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Because you see like that these this is not a new cause of action. It's just

245
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:46,600
you're making education of fat that would bring you into whatever remedy you're asking.

246
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,200
Well, if I find religion that CBS is a criminal organization.

247
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:01,700
Okay, let's not lose too much time on this. Okay. So here saying let's say 17 a is a new plane because it's finished.

248
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,500
There before that was there before.

249
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:24,600
So that this new apart from that because you didn't ask for 2004 we did ask for 15,000.

250
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,900
I'm just not seeing.

251
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,300
New cause of action that would stand on their own.

252
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,800
the honor this

253
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,400
without finding specifically the paragraph because they're so many that I had touched the allegation of

254
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,400
money laundering and criminal organization are new.

255
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,700
Okay, and what what's the point of this do you were saying that these would stand on their own in another proceedings?

256
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,900
They can be pursued on their own. So

257
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,200
now there's not Time bar.

258
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:12,500
You have the time limitation issue. You cannot take an action, you know 20 years from the date of the events and say I have this

259
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,900
is correct. But at the time that they maybe was proposed.

260
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,600
I had only just learned about the money laundering.

261
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Okay, you can always what you're saying is that you can

262
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,400
take a separate action. Is that what you're

263
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
saying? Well, yes.

264
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,900
Okay. So why don't you that's what you say

265
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,800
because that would not be the most vicious and and this cost way to reach Justice.

266
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,700
Okay, that's your argument for why you made an error?

267
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,900
Because we have to make sense of this.

268
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,300
Well, you are my argument is that he used evidence where shouldn't have?

269
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,900
the court

270
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,400
I'm sorry. My presentation is

271
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,700
no I'm just trying to make sure that I don't want to miss what you're saying.

272
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,400
You started with that. Okay that you should not have look at that. I thought

273
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,800
well, you said that he may not look at evidence on

274
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:31,400
2.181 a but it can't accept there's a they are exception under eight for to addiction. For example.

275
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Well, they're not stated in their rules. You're on.

276
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Yeah, but they're stated in the case of

277
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,500
that's very cute in their role. It doesn't say anything that the rule is being construed by case law.

278
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,200
and

279
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,200
if I'm not mistaken, it's fun for

280
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
That but anyway, I

281
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,300
am

282
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,900
operating we continue

283
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,100
operating under the guidance of the Supreme Court.

284
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,100
Says very clearly and without doubt.

285
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,500
All

286
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,900
okay. Let's let's

287
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,200
continue

288
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:46,300
and 23

289
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:05,500
What is impossible to enumerate all the factors that a judge must take into participation determining whether an adjustment?

290
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:21,400
Where is it whether it is just a given case to authorizing Amendment. The general rules is that an amendment should be allowed at any state or the action for the purpose of determining their real questions and controversy between the department provided notably that the allowance will not result in an injustice.

291
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,800
For the other party and not capable of being compensated by an award of costs.

292
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,500
That's good. That's good. As I told you don't lose too much time on the law. We can read it

293
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:38,500
in case you're under that is oh I have for

294
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,600
this presentation

295
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,900
that's that's

296
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,500
wrong in using evidence

297
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,700
and that would be an airplane.

298
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,900
specifically

299
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:08,000
Or it might be an error in his that is a reasons are not clear enough as to which paragraph he was looking at.

300
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:21,400
Well the owner in a few words I can demonstrate why looking at sectional 106 which is what the defendant proposed is flawed to look at that point. And that's for

301
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,000
the amendment.

302
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,600
No, one of the Customs out.

303
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,900
Yes, but we're now looking at are you

304
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:36,500
on the amendment? I'm only doing with the members so far. I'm understanding that. We're addressing these two cases separately.

305
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,900
No, but what your hour and a half is for the two of them?

306
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,700
It's three hours for both.

307
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,600
Yes. We are only dealing with

308
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,000
so what

309
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,200
do you want to say about so

310
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:59,700
many six the pendant proposed officers wear?

311
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,600
Would not be liable.

312
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,600
For their actions under the custom job.

313
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,100
Yes.

314
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:15,200
Nobody do not be liable. Not under the customer's of

315
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,000
Activities.

316
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,700
Yes

317
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,000
under the Customs act and yes, they are nothing for someone

318
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,100
okay, if they are not in pursuant.

319
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,500
The Crown cannot be the vicariously liable.

320
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:35,000
You cannot sue the Crown for something done outside of their duties. You can sue them, but you cannot sue the Crown.

321
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,700
Well the crown

322
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:42,200
either they are inside their Duty and the crown because of the employer are liable for them.

323
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,600
Okay, they cherish me or they're not doing it on their Duty then they are responsible for it.

324
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,600
Well, they're not doing it in their personal capacity.

325
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:11,100
What if they're doing a frog that's what you're saying? They're doing a fraud. It's and it's outside of the customer. You're trying to get out of Windows 6 to get out of Windows 6. You have to get out of the crust on that and you have to get out of the vicarious liability of the front.

326
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,800
You know, the word is

327
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,300
not really

328
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:24,200
cares means you are responsible for your agents and employees for what he did in the performance of their Duty.

329
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:25,900
See what

330
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,100
and

331
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,400
so you could sue them personally.

332
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,400
And that may not come under one was six if it is outside of their Duty.

333
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:45,000
But that's not be within the jurisdiction of our core because we only can entertain that kind of action against the crown itself,

334
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,500
correct?

335
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,900
The other person assuming that the thought is true.

336
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,700
Assuming that the fact is traded

337
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,100
are true.

338
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,700
Fraud would have to be one of the tools that these officers are allowed to employ to implement the custom job.

339
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,600
They have a number of activities that they can employers actually searches questioning.

340
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,900
Okay, and

341
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,000
that's why the protection 106 does not protect them from yes,

342
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,600
and how do you

343
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:26,000
Why do you think that the crown can be liable for something that is not within their Duty?

344
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,000
you know, putting their duty of anything to abroad.

345
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,600
their Duty

346
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:05,100
If we had met on the street and they asked me for for my coins, I would not have given this to them as a personal as a person.

347
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,000
as an individual I only gave him my coins because they were

348
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,100
young in case you know that you

349
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,200
for one was it?

350
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,200
And that they could not apply to the front.

351
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,300
the one Florida I can point to

352
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,900
is about to

353
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,700
yes,

354
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,600
which is

355
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,400
already for one of two and I referring to

356
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,400
versus Canada pitch 46

357
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,200
Network and no check

358
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,100
their

359
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,300
second

360
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,300
the case that I have

361
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,900
is all about

362
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,300
No at 46 mm.

363
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,000
the courgette

364
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,500
second loss on the four days

365
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,100
just a second.

366
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,600
I don't have a 46 in the other one so attached.

367
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,600
Yes, it is one of the longer table.

368
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,300
Yes and my page 46.

369
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,900
Oh, is it because you didn't?

370
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,300
Did you just put Pages without the front and just a page out of the text?

371
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:12,600
Yes.

372
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:17,900
the

373
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,000
point about that case though just to bring us back to the

374
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:32,700
point is that under paragraph 30 if if illegal acts are really done from the motive other than a modest drive to execute a statutory or legal Duty.

375
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:42,400
Then the public of that towards the end. The public authorities Act is not Advanced for the acts complaint.

376
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Of are not done in the headache execution of a statute, but only in the pretended execution Darrow.

377
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:52,700
that's

378
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
not

379
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,500
the one of the tools that they can employ they were however using

380
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:16,400
pretending to access customers officers pretending that these coins where goes so that they could see them and request their

381
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:24,700
understanding for something that's outside of their Duty.

382
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,700
Uh, and that's the crown is the act.

383
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,300
Do you have

384
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,200
they were on

385
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,200
just a second have you put Council the prom night identity and section?

386
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,600
I have

387
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,500
the

388
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,200
color liability.

389
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,700
is 101

390
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,300
11

391
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,500
at age 12

392
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:12,800
for the damage for which it could wear a person it would be liable.

393
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,800
Yes, and

394
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,300
any other problems in respect of a tort committed by a servant of the crown?

395
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,300
the full

396
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,500
I don't know if the

397
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,200
things you brought

398
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,700
the same thing

399
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,500
outside of their duties totally

400
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,900
Responsible so we have to look at this

401
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,700
but they

402
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,900
just saying don't have it before you before us we'll have to look at

403
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,800
all right?

404
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,600
Good. So what will do is to make sure that you have?

405
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,200
I don't want to construe 31.

406
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Okay, 3 a little eye without you being able to make submissions on it.

407
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,600
So I would

408
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:28,700
give you.

409
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,000
Or Thursday with the end of the day next Monday.

410
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:45,200
Be a good you can write to the court and say here are some Authority that I would like to submit to show that a fraud would come with them.

411
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,600
three

412
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:55,700
I'm not able to I am out of the my home country for a week.

413
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,800
I live in Mexico I have for much of the time I came here specialty.

414
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,100
Um, can I have two weeks?

415
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,200
Until the following.

416
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:14,000
Yes it just that we won't be so long as the case is not closed. We cannot render a decision if I give you two weeks.

417
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,600
I'm just saying I don't know when you'll get your decision because we sit everywhere.

418
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,600
and the time to write your case by the next week, so

419
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,500
well, in any case I have I have no way of getting of sitting down and looking at this until

420
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,700
at the very least Wednesday

421
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,500
the earliest Wednesday

422
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,300
Okay, so, okay. You'll have to wait.

423
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,200
that means

424
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,800
And you understand what we're looking for.

425
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,500
Um, my understanding is that you are looking for representations as to why the crowd of the

426
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,400
Sure, and I can meet their pointed out. We're looking at three B.

427
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,200
little I

428
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,600
because it's not the province of today.

429
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,500
Another problem.

430
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,000
Yes.

431
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,200
Okay, so three

432
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,800
so why should be like in

433
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,600
the case of would apply to make the crown viable for fraud?

434
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
for frog permitted outside of their

435
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,700
Are we making this assumption that if they were working on the clock and working on?

436
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
working on this feature

437
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,100
that they are outside of their doing.

438
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:12,900
They are trying to

439
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,600
that's what you are supposed to I'm giving you a chance to argue this point.

440
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,400
Okay.

441
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,000
Thank you.

442
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,800
Wow, that is all I have for 8411.

443
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,500
for just additions I would like to move on to

444
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,000
and obviously

445
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
the other side will have the right to respond

446
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
respond. Yes,

447
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:39,700
there are.

448
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,400
numerous probable errors

449
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,000
to discuss the first one

450
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,200
the judge was required to find whether

451
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,200
section 1.02

452
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,700
let me these backtrack and he's saying

453
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,900
and explain the larger picture

454
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,900
in the 102 and the

455
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,900
motion for

456
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
summary judgment

457
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,300
the defendant made for presentation

458
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,500
to guide the way the case was considered he

459
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:23,900
completed

460
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,300
and appeal under Section

461
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,500
132 135

462
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,300
135 with the purpose of the entire action.

463
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:36,700
He

464
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,100
represented that

465
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,100
Wherever section 1325 claim appears.

466
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:59,500
The preceding is a special type of proceeding that is outside of those defined under the federal court rules. He said he said that it is not neither an application for you neither.

467
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,800
An ordinary action, neither a simplified action neither a class action.

468
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:14,500
He alleges that an appeal is just a different type of proceeding where the cord is being asked to.

469
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,200
reconsider

470
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,300
a new the decision that was before Minister. He represents that.

471
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,000
The job of the task before the judge was to decide.

472
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,200
in The Minister's place

473
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,200
based on new evidence

474
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,100
was it was a contradiction or not?

475
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,300
Guiding the preceding this way can only lead to.

476
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,200
an outcome in his favor

477
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,700
and it is incorrect the an appeal.

478
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:04,600
Under 16001 305 is simply one plane.

479
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,200
that can be entered as part of the

480
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,100
ordinary National

481
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,200
the preceding type

482
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:19,600
that you're allowed to make a 135 claim under is an ordinary action.

483
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,300
and the

484
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,600
appeal is only one of

485
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,200
the claims available

486
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,200
However, there is nothing in the Customs Act that preclude a plaintiff from.

487
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:46,000
From joining other other claims that arise from the same class from the same details.

488
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,500
Do you agree because the judge on two cases start?

489
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,700
a decision

490
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,200
Are we in Korean?

491
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,700
Yes,

492
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,300
and now

493
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,000
these two cases deal with

494
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,100
And that an action or a negation?

495
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,400
contensting the amount of penalty.

496
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,900
You can test the amount of penalty interaction.

497
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:42,400
No,

498
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:49,500
okay. So do you agree that if we follow these cases because in that custom app?

499
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,600
clear that to

500
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,400
challenge a decision on the penalty

501
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,900
you have to go to a judicial.

502
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:58,800
I do not.

503
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,900
Penalties.

504
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,100
Yes, I do not.

505
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So you can't test that.

506
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,400
Yes.

507
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,700
Okay, even though you're not doing it.

508
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,000
Correct.

509
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:08,900
So

510
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:10,900
you

511
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:30,700
have

512
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,000
everything

513
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,100
I believe

514
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,900
star we was.

515
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,500
In Star way, there were two issues.

516
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:26,100
There was both with it whether they issue that there was a an infection and all so the issue of whether the minister could keep that line.

517
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,000
He the dark specifically looked.

518
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,400
And explained that it makes no sense to allow the defendant to keep.

519
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,200
The terms of release if the decision was cannot stand.

520
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,300
I'm sorry. Yeah.

521
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,400
amount of the penalty one must apply for two children

522
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:00,000
Before it has been determined that the case committed. This is an nominee. Okay.

523
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,000
and everybody has said it's an enemy but

524
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Well, it may be an anomaly. I am referring to starway at my authority page 44 and 45.

525
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,100
They're just 27 and 28.

526
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,700
Okay

527
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,900
start with

528
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,600
20 seconds

529
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,900
44

530
00:51:44,200 --> 00:52:00,500
That's that's an ordinary National. The only special rolling pose. Was that whether Mr. Start with it or not? Just kidding first of all.

531
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:08,000
I will deal with this a little later. The amount of penalty is not an issue. This is a child mother paper review.

532
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,900
Yes, and where does he say that you can dispute the penalty?

533
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,700
In an action

534
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:28,500
the next paragraph paragraph 28 begins with the next issue the position of the penalty not the amount of the road.

535
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
The defendant submit that at best I can only declare and so on and so on.

536
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:45,800
At the end of the paragraph the paragraph 28 Star Wars says since there was no infraction of the Customs act it follows that defendants cannot keep the amount forfeit.

537
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Yeah, but that's a different question. I was talking to you about the amount of dependents.

538
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,900
I know that in your action, you do discuss that the amount was reduced by the minister.

539
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,200
three

540
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:14,200
once there is no contraction. What can you do? Obviously, there's no contributions. There's no control

541
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:25,100
your others that the defendant states that the only available remedy for you for the court is to declare what it was will not contribute.

542
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,500
He specifically says

543
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:36,600
I didn't know nothing else, but you were going with okay. So you're trying to say under 135. What are the remnants?

544
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,300
But what we're looking at now is whether you can.

545
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,800
Be very cute and application.

546
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,200
Or an ordinary action to contest the amount of the penalty.

547
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,000
Well, they are

548
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,100
but there's an issue

549
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,400
it is a client.

550
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,300
I would like to point out ACL.

551
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:10,500
I'm not I have to say I'm not 100% I just want to make sure we get your point on this.

552
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,700
I would like to point out to ACL as another example where

553
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,300
bringing it back to your

554
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,000
part

555
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,200
I'm saying that.

556
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,000
just because

557
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,800
a claim under Section 135 discontinued within an ordinary option. Yes.

558
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:43,500
There is no provision in the Customs act to make it the exclusive claim that can be made in that ordinary action,

559
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:43,900
right?

560
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:51,500
There's no the customers that itself does not limit does not say that you may not have another claim that is related to

561
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,600
the same time. And what's not clear is

562
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:00,000
if it is clear in customary.

563
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,800
certain issues need to be dealt with by judicial review

564
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,800
certain decision

565
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:22,300
That's that's the problem. I'm trying to eliminate. Is there anything in your plane?

566
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:31,700
That would be comparable to the planes that were made in the two cases on which their Church relies.

567
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:42,900
Which is just staring. Yes, there are multiple multiple claims multiple clamps in the same options.

568
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,300
Is there any of those claims in your action?

569
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,500
That are the same as the planes that were dealt with in Star Wars and

570
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,400
New Year. Well, they're not the same claims.

571
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Not same

572
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
at the same time.

573
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,400
I think that's the point that you you want to make.

574
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:10,200
It's not what is dealt with in those cases was something that needed to be done by application.

575
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,000
not by actions

576
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:27,400
we were to discuss the if I could if I were to address this issue of application versus action the Customs does not even require the amount of people just good by way of about the issue.

577
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,100
Yes, but that's

578
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,200
that's what it's supposed to be.

579
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
This decision have to be about federal office.

580
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:53,400
But all this must be done, you know, there can be a conversion if you want wet damages from that decision.

581
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,100
And this is why I was pointing to ACL kind of so,

582
00:56:59,100 --> 00:56:59,700
yeah.

583
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
fish 42

584
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:22,100
here in ACL the judge looked at section 135 claim and concluded at airglass 61.

585
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,000
Yes

586
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
third line from the bottom that

587
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:33,400
under the section 135 the flame the Vintage action and this regard must be dismissed.

588
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,900
within that regard

589
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,200
which Regard

590
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,300
in regard to section 135

591
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,400
Okay, so

592
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,500
why is that of interest to us? It seems to confirm with the judge was saying

593
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,600
it's just so under 35 135.

594
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:28,200
That specific claim can be dismissed. However, he went on to consider the claim under 1:33 and following paragraph paragraph 60.

595
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,300
Actually the second following paragraph

596
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:39,700
93 and also clean and declaration and it is in tactical to retainment and return of the forfeit himself.

597
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,700
and

598
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,500
63

599
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,100
and it's a leader as a matter.

600
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,700
Of 35 does not give them.

601
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:20,200
That's right. And he says either 135 or otherwise under the act or the general jurisdiction of the Court.

602
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,700
which which means that if if

603
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:32,800
A relief thought was within the general jerk editions of the course. He would he would have to consider it.

604
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,900
He did not consider the that relief only because he was concerning section one.

605
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:42,900
33

606
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,700
but you were relying on a passage.

607
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:58,600
Where you said the judge confirmed that the court could give could make an order or for that. There's no money for people that was the previous case that you called.

608
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:07,300
And now they're saying we don't have that jurisdiction. So these two cases will have to go and look at okay.

609
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:19,300
if another if another remedy within the

610
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:27,100
Action was within the general jurisdiction of the tradition of the Court. He would have to consider it.

611
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:36,700
Yes. He says it's not within the jurisdiction for 50 that's come directly to what you just said before

612
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,800
that's specific claim you are right,

613
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,400
you know, what will be there because

614
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,100
I found

615
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:49,100
that we should be distinguishing to start.

616
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:59,900
You know, no I'm not let me just finish my thought your I think saying that the judge was wrong and in.

617
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,000
Losing those two cases through a lot of fun.

618
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,100
Because of your case is differently, it can be distinguished and you're relying on ACL.

619
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,200
to say that the court has

620
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,600
more jurisdiction to deal with these matters. Is that is that what it is

621
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,700
it is however in in

622
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:27,600
yes, so we based on ACL the port does have more services addition to consider.

623
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,200
your clients

624
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,700
Visitors section one is 33 which is additional clients.

625
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,000
Okay,

626
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,600
so I want to make sure I understand your points. Okay?

627
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:51,900
There's one which is a page 45. It would continue on reading his family after we talked about he pointed out these he says the money he can't keep the money that there's no one fraction.

628
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:53,400
Then

629
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,400
kind of playing on his self-portrait. There's allocation should be returned.

630
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,000
Now, so was it just over your comments in

631
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,200
the judge?

632
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:06,000
Or do you have to order the money thing? Because they have to have the judgment.

633
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:17,700
That will go on and even though they may not have jurisdiction to deal with something just point out the Trap as long as my decision. You really should do something even though it may not be able to order you to do something.

634
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,100
I don't know if there was an order or

635
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:29,200
it was just not well the seems to be logical thing you really

636
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:29,700
should do.

637
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,800
So we'll look at that. What?

638
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:48,300
I would like post a point out and paragraph 63 of ACL.

639
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,600
the judge did

640
01:02:53,900 --> 01:03:04,100
towards the end hate hands with I conclude that in order should go setting aside the minister determination made under section one, but his face and referring both Myers back for

641
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:04,900
restoration

642
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,400
by another judicator.

643
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,300
So that means that even in an action in an ordinary action.

644
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,200
Section 133 was good,

645
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:23,900
you know what would read the case because that's why normally you shouldn't have a page like this. We don't have to have the whole case here have it all.

646
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,300
Before but we'll look at so that's your third.

647
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,800
What else do you want to say about 102?

648
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,500
about jointer

649
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,500
It's again.

650
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,200
It's

651
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,100
six of your rules

652
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,200
Well, there's no claim of underwater systems.

653
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,500
I'm talking about the rules. You're not talking.

654
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,400
Yes, that will want to want.

655
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,400
to

656
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,700
subject to

657
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:28,400
rules to a party to my request really good against another party as interesting in respect of more than one client.

658
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,000
Yes.

659
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:38,600
So it would be incorrect. So it was a palpable number right here for for the motion injection.

660
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:46,700
To disallow this Rule and claimed that only a section 135 claim can be made in an ordinary action.

661
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,400
when the rules of thrill Court obviously say otherwise

662
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:59,500
anything else

663
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:07,500
Yes.

664
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:11,400
You're going very well.

665
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,600
You're right.

666
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,600
Yeah, that's why that's

667
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,300
just to a party may occur the court May order separate clamps.

668
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,300
Or many orders that came to be split or to be dealt with in a more convenient fashion.

669
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,200
So with your saying is they should have split it.

670
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,800
If you thought that this was completed as a dismissal,

671
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,400
that's right.

672
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:53,900
Okay.

673
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:05,200
Because just ignoring and and the spacing claims without looking at them. There's no justice in that.

674
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,000
it's not an interest or just

675
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,400
okay.

676
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,400
I'd like to point out.

677
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,700
the X-ray stats are

678
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,700
but this goes again to multiple.

679
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,300
Preceding

680
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:27,500
proceedings to multiple claims in the same proceeding.

681
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:27,900
Yeah

682
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,800
such.

683
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:30,900
as

684
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:42,300
I don't have my I wouldn't need a few seconds to find the section that I'm talking about

685
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,100
the thing that just happened.

686
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,000
It's in your book of a turkey.

687
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,500
25 that I think 25 is the definition of money.

688
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,900
the first year around 15

689
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,900
I may have messed up or if you 1.28.

690
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,500
and 18

691
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,600
21 was in

692
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:49,500
my house

693
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,300
I am a little.

694
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:34,000
You know what we could do. Okay, because you're almost at the end of your time. Okay, but what would you will break for five minutes?

695
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:40,700
Yeah,

696
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,800
thank you.

697
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,000
order

698
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,000
Which means?

699
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:03,300
Which means that under the Customs activities no such limitation is given it cannot be implied. The chronometer does have the

700
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,600
ability to do it

701
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:22,900
I like to move on to the next point the next clear are the most engaging ignored the plaintiff evidence. The first one would have been currently the Currency Act section 11.

702
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:24,400
Which is that?

703
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,700
Which is authorities book page.

704
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,400
That's where you want to do it the statute.

705
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,900
It's not currency.

706
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,300
It is evidence my understanding of both the answers that.

707
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,800
The acts that I bring that I present to the court with my case,

708
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,200
yes

709
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,700
are part of my evidence but

710
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:09,900
statutes are another their statutes. So don't worry. It means that it might be an error to steal an error.

711
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,000
not consider

712
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,200
relevant section

713
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,200
so you're saying why is it relevant and

714
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,400
it is relevant because specifically

715
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:51,100
By the minister milk break down or otherwise otherwise known as currency any coin that is currently that are encounter.

716
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,500
I like gone online to use otherwise, then it's currently.

717
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,500
Relevant because the current status itself tells us that girls cannot be treated as Goods.

718
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:15,100
If you're not being used as good as good as Goods or something else, it can only be used. It's only a token of current.

719
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:17,900
is specifically

720
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,300
so you're saying

721
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,900
you should go to your argument.

722
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,300
According to your head in this case for the US coin. Yes.

723
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:30,400
I think

724
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,400
they could have an account.

725
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,500
They're not a good time in Canada.

726
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,700
How does 111 apply?

727
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:50,800
there's a pale apparel was drawn and it was on contested by other party that Quentin of the United States the treatment of the United States and in Canada are parallel and equivalent legislation and the rules that would apply to coins in to

728
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,700
corresponding coins in Canada

729
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,700
also applying to currency of the United States

730
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:17,800
What can I have a similar points as the ones I had which are $50 gold coins and five dollar one dollar coins?

731
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:30,600
So the point is that if the Canadian coins cannot can be not not treated cannot be treated as good or as something other than currency. Then the US coins cannot find it.

732
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,200
It's not faces you say that.

733
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:45,600
You honor the the United States public law. That is the that is the corresponding loss of the Canadian one to the Persia States. This has the same

734
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,700
but in the world USAC only applies in the US.

735
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,300
And the Canadian act applies in Canada?

736
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:55,100
so I'm not understanding why the fact that

737
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:02,100
If you ask coins are not currency in Canada a legal tender

738
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:07,600
currency, they are currency in the United States.

739
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,300
Yes.

740
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,600
If there were Native coins.

741
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:18,200
They could also not be considered Goods for the reasons of section one section 11.

742
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:27,200
No question of my colleague was why would this act?

743
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
apply to you whisper

744
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,500
because it shows that kinetic coins are treated.

745
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,400
in a specific way

746
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:38,600
Yes,

747
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,000
and it was never anything contention any

748
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,700
energy because this section cannot apply Direct.

749
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,500
The under the defense agreed that coins of the

750
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,400
we don't care that the breeze or not.

751
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,100
If it's a matter of know we need to know what your positions

752
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:59,600
well in that case. I would have to present the current section from the United States.

753
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
They're not.

754
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,700
Okay. So what is saying is paragraph?

755
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,100
section 11

756
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,100
with apply if they were coins in Canadian bird seed

757
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:24,700
you say my answer by analogy.

758
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:32,200
We should treat the US the same way because the US act as absolutely no application here,

759
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,300
correct.

760
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,600
Okay, so it's by another.

761
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:50,500
Next one. I like to point out that.

762
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:59,700
the motion judge error significant are in accepting the defendant explanation not

763
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,200
the Customs act applies to all Goods

764
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,600
which is not true, they

765
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:31,800
The Customs Act is activated specifically by the excise tax act. It doesn't just come into Force out of the blue for everything that you bring into Canada. For instance. If you import food or water or even my own vehicle that I was driving that day. I was not required to report it to declare it as important in Canada, even though I did in Portland in Canada.

766
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:33,400
and

767
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:42,700
I was not required to declare it. I did not declare it. It's not a problem. The question is why is this because it is a good it is quite valuable.

768
01:16:43,700 --> 01:17:01,200
And so on so we would the tests that he applied to the coins. The reason Goods in general are not immediately subjects. The Customs are is because the Customs the Customs act power is given by the exercise section 51

769
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
which which tells us that that authorities page 15.

770
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:24,400
about 15

771
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:24,800
or 16

772
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,600
we're described where

773
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,300
maybe we can be more precise where

774
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:36,200
of course session 15.8.

775
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:42,200
50 sorry 50.1 50.1

776
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:43,900
point B

777
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,900
And then 51.

778
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,200
so one

779
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:56,300
So

780
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,000
just a second one. I would just read it.

781
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:23,500
Says that this section gives us what the purpose of the Customs Act is and is what octaves the Customs to act on things that are important.

782
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,400
So it's only on

783
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:35,900
Goods that are

784
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:45,500
I'm not sure that I understand what you're saying because 50 says that there shall be imposed a consumption tax.

785
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:53,300
Was imported in Canada payable in accordance with the provision of the custom Act.

786
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,000
Yes.

787
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:56,700
So this

788
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:01,100
it doesn't say that you don't have to be clear something under the customer.

789
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:08,000
It says that the Customs are just unnecessary in the case.

790
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,000
No, no, it does not your part. This section does not.

791
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,300
Okay. So which section because you're

792
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,200
sexually 51.

793
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:30,100
Shows the acceptance 5146 not apply on the sale orientation of good mention is schedule 3.

794
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,400
Yes. So the fact that there's no hats.

795
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,200
Why does it mean that you don't have

796
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:40,700
because there is no tax to be collected in accordance with the Customs Act.

797
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,400
Will have to look at the provision of the first analysis.

798
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,500
I don't think it leaves you.

799
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,200
determine whether

800
01:19:54,500 --> 01:20:01,400
We'll have to look at the provision of the Customs Act if it says in the Care on the goods on which taxes faithful.

801
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,900
The Customs act does not do that. It does not activate itself.

802
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,900
It doesn't nobody doesn't say that you have to be clear.

803
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:13,100
It does not.

804
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,700
That is not the Customs Act.

805
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:24,400
Drop to do the Customs Act only comes into effect in case there is tax to be collected.

806
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,628
And in case there is tax to be collected,

807
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:38,100
it is to be collected in accordance with the Customs Act. That means you have to declare it and you have to pay the tax. 

808
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:38,500
Okay, that's your position. That's fine. Your next point?

809
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:56,300
Page 20, which is one of the exemptions.

810
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,300
and on page 20 part 5

811
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:13,400
contribute part 11 for an upper line part 11 of schedule 3. It's on page 22

812
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I remember 7 years.

813
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,500
exemptions from

814
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,700
a quotation tax

815
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,300
that is to be collected according to the Customs Act.

816
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:38,000
So paragraph three and four of part state that British and Canadian coins.

817
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,000
and foreign gold coin

818
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,700
our Exempted from importation tax

819
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,900
and the application of the Customs tax.

820
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,500
setup

821
01:21:51,100 --> 01:22:02,800
4 of part 11 says point of any metal but fossilized weight and designed Fisher for use as currency under the authority of the government of any country. So this would include the United States.

822
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:04,900
are exempt from

823
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:12,200
a partition tax and therefore collection of the importation tax 100 Customs out.

824
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,900
And it follows that if if there is no tax.

825
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,200
to be paid

826
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:27,800
and the Customs act does not it does not need to be enforced. There's no point to declare things that we're not needed to be.

827
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,800
Taxed and this is why your point if I take it is

828
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,800
it it's

829
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,200
no tax and Photon are good. And there's no you do not have to clear that we come to the Border.

830
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:42,100
That is correct. And that is not following that logic. It's someone right at the

831
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:42,800
border with fresh fruit.

832
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,800
From another country

833
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,200
you're saying it wouldn't have to.

834
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,100
Declare that because no tax on.

835
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:58,000
It's so far as the fruits that you this not use fruit as an example because there's a agricultural but where does that fit into your

836
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,500
and the cutlet?

837
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,200
What fruit?

838
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:07,800
Fruits will not be declared under Customs. It would be declared as under the agriculture or not.

839
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:23,200
Yes, but one for taxation purposes, but for germs and for other certification purposes, well, let's use a car your personal car or an object that is not subject to the other cultural or not.

840
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:31,100
Like the coins like inner objects, the car that I was driving was not subject to the importation of dice.

841
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:37,700
But but did you buy that car in the United States? I did not so guess that during the what the word imported me.

842
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:51,300
Does the word important only mean bringing Goods that you required outside the country as poet returning Goods that came from Canada and are bringing back to Canada's incorrect. I believe it's the distinction is not.

843
01:23:52,800 --> 01:24:02,200
On what deportation means but on whether the taxes payable the car was no doubt imported because it was outside the country in the morning. It was inside the country in the afternoon.

844
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,100
if you look like

845
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:19,600
so, can you remind me of the the section I'm material doesn't have it and I'm going to go look for it later my book of authorities, unfortunately, or

846
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:30,600
There's a problem with it. Yeah, so, can you just repeat to me exactly the thank you. That's where I wasn't clear and I didn't have it.

847
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:37,200
I'm sorry. It just scheduled three part 11 points three and four.

848
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,400
Okay. Thank you.

849
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:59,900
If you bring for example other foodstuffs that are for example chips or things that are not subject to agricultural controls. You do not have to report it to report it. In fact many people try to cross the border to buy their groceries and they come back.

850
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:13,600
Does not have to be before it the same day that I came in with these coins. I have also bought some water a bottle of water and some petting mitigation. I had a headache that day medication is also exempt from taxation.

851
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:25,000
Which is the reason why I did not have to report it. My car did not have to be reported because tax on it had already been paid when the car was initially imported into Canada. So

852
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,300
it was not subject because it was not something on which.

853
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:30,900
You had already

854
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:36,600
because there was no tax filing on it those nuts to do to be collected.

855
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,700
It's not because it was important.

856
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,700
Okay, so we got your point now we have to worry because you have

857
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,100
baseball

858
01:25:50,800 --> 01:26:16,900
Wow, the evidence submitted by the defendant which was only paragraph only the Customs Act is the only evidence he had to offer in support of his position that the goods are running the judge found that that position and that evidence is not helpful to his to his point and he found that in fact according to the customer to the Currency Act. The coins are in fact courtesy and legal tender in the United States or

859
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,600
and they are not good.

860
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,200
according to the Customs Act

861
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,500
not according to the evidence.

862
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,200
Okay, what's your point

863
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,000
in order for him to find that they were good? She had to introduce some evidence of his own.

864
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:43,000
that was nothing that was waiting based on what is defendant said he never

865
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,200
Found this right?

866
01:26:58,900 --> 01:26:59,400
Okay, so

867
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,600
You mean that he's bringing up an argument that was not put to it.

868
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,900
Is that what you're saying it just argue. That is correct.

869
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:15,600
Okay, so it was a new argument that was not put by the parties before?

870
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,600
Okay, that's a different. Yeah.

871
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,700
And which paragraph?

872
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,100
Okay decision.

873
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:02,300
six

874
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:06,600
exercise

875
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,300
this definition was not the owner

876
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:16,500
know. But yeah, it was before it once you put the mat.

877
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,500
Judge has to look at that the act as a whole cannot just read the acronym look at the definition.

878
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:29,100
However, the the defendant did not submit that this is the reason why he thinks the coins are

879
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,800
ya good. It's a matter of you.

880
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:35,100
See that terms of law you can agree you can see.

881
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,000
the church

882
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,500
So the Act was before

883
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,000
and it's not like he looked at.

884
01:28:44,200 --> 01:29:01,400
This definition of money. There's not a normative. It is only its context there's specific to section 1.3. Unfortunately my in my this is a very long section of the definitions is very long. I did not include it and in my

885
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:01,900
authority,

886
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:20,800
but at the heading of it says that this this definition only implies for that's Obsession. It's not a general definition of money, which does not exist in any law do not have a definition of legal definition for one money is this is only a placeholder the same.

887
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,500
rewriting the same long paragraph

888
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:33,200
Okay, so it cannot be just for the purpose of 1.3 has to be for the purpose of Park nine.

889
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,700
The definition

890
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:47,200
is adapted in part nine. So subtraction 1:23. So what you're saying, it applies only to the part or wherever it says that it applies. That

891
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:47,700
is correct.

892
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,300
Not in another act.

893
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,100
That's correct.

894
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,000
Okay, that's good.

895
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,500
So what did he do that with that? I don't think that he

896
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:03,300
so this was the only basis on which he found the coins can be considered Goods.

897
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,300
Nothing in the defendants or the planets because of patients to give.

898
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,300
Any evidence that they can be considered quotes?

899
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,300
Too long. I'm in arguments you have left.

900
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,000
I have

901
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:57,500
just before just just raise the Damned because we we cannot

902
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:07,800
okay the honor the third of 53 of the reasons for the judge called analysis of white coins are currency, but the person that reporting under section 12 of the customs.

903
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,000
that is

904
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:27,800
5345 for a section 12 one of Customs are therefore triggered.

905
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,800
Yes, but you were under 10,000.

906
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,400
My point is that I believe this is a

907
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,700
it doesn't like you.

908
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,300
It does apply to me, but if it should it should the limit of 10,000 should apply to me.

909
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,600
Yes, so

910
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,700
in case I did have more than 10,000 I should have had to to report them.

911
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:51,600
Yes, but he does say that it is.

912
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:58,500
Yes, he uses the word. The reporting obligation is provided other section 12 of the

913
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:58,800
Customs

914
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,100
not.

915
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,200
his analysis pertained to

916
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,900
I don't see the word customized me proceeds.

917
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,300
act here's this process that

918
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:14,800
in the first sentence, but the second sentence he talks about the reporting obligations.

919
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:15,600
you know, but

920
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:21,300
the reporting obligation provided for at section 121 of the proceed.

921
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,200
That customers. Yeah.

922
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:13,100
The official version is perceived at

923
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,300
the correct. Yes.

924
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,400
Perfect. So we'll leave that.

925
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:17,900
Okay, so

926
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:18,900
at this point false.

927
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,600
You may have incorrect it. I know that this was corrected.

928
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,900
at some point for Aires

929
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,100
Not that I recall.

930
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,100
Okay, that's fine.

931
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:38,100
instead of the official version

932
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:45,900
of the website

933
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:51,600
from the official version.

934
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:59,000
Well, I will take your word. I believe this is a few mistake to make and it'll be awesome.

935
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,600
So let's go to the next one

936
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,600
the next one.

937
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:21,200
but overlooks specifically section 501

938
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:26,300
Which deals with the importation the only generally looks at?

939
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,400
This I probably maybe might not even if

940
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,800
you can write. Okay next.

941
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:39,500
Because we don't have a choice. We have their appeals this afternoon and your friend ask is entitled to his time.

942
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,700
You are on a

943
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,400
motion for summary judgment

944
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:48,700
It should be.

945
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:56,300
It should not be granted. Okay?

946
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:16,400
some of judgment the judge needs to have confidence in his so sufficient evidence must be available that he can confidently determine the matter if you

947
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,000
Well 58 is goods are broken sensor 68.

948
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,100
6868

949
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:50,000
having concluded both the customers and the proceeds are applied by currently. I will address the issue of overlapping provisions.

950
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:57,800
And then he discusses the character further below it that paragraph 70 the course. I recognized the scope and application.

951
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,300
Okay.

952
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,200
And he talks about conflict on overlap.

953
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:01,600
Okay,

954
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,900
so that's the wording of complex.

955
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,100
Yes.

956
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:06,700
You're saying.

957
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,400
Absolutely.

958
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:33,100
has not argue that the coins they probably said

959
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,300
oh.

960
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:46,700
Which is part of the motion record.

961
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:54,900
So

962
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:59,100
Benjamin paragraph 915 of the year?

963
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:10,700
Exactly that point,

964
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,500
okay.

965
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:19,000
So 65 page paragraph 9. Okay next.

966
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:25,900
You are pet the other significant errors that had.

967
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:27,900
felt was

968
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,600
135 is

969
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,100
for judicial review

970
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:48,000
By the cost of job so means that there's the decision of the minister not.

971
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,300
Not to try to delete his own decision based on Fresh evidence.

972
01:37:54,987 --> 01:38:00,491
No, but because it's on fresh evidence, it cannot be just a review.

973
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:01,300
But there is

974
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:06,600
un-french that a new evidence. That's the purpose of doing it by way of action.

975
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:08,100
No, Your Honor.

976
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,050
but as part of

977
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,200
I'm very sorry. I have to disagree.

978
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,307
No, okay, but let's do this quickly

979
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:22,700
I'm faced with an impossible task of proving a huge case in a very short time.

980
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:24,917
It's three hours.

981
01:38:24,917 --> 01:38:26,264
I understand.

982
01:38:26,264 --> 01:38:29,000
We are bound by the Chief Justice duration.

983
01:38:29,914 --> 01:38:31,213
We cannot extend.

984
01:38:31,251 --> 01:38:33,251
May I request an adjurment?

985
01:38:33,251 --> 01:38:34,846
NO!

986
01:38:34,846 --> 01:38:41,050
Would you make your point the last point talking about the judicial review

987
01:38:41,133 --> 01:39:00,395
Your Honour, in order to do a judicial review, the judge would have had to consider the Minister's consideration of the evidence before him, and whether he reached a conclusion in a intelligible manner according to Dunsmuir Supreme Court Case 2008

988
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:14,479
so the minister's decision would have had to be intelligible so that the plaintiff has a chance to defend against it, and such that a reviewing court would understand how it was made.

989
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:20,600
He was not deciding the action he was deciding a summary judgment based on a question of law.

990
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:32,800
So if you say it was not enough to determine that question to to strike the action, say that, and then we'll pass the next one.

991
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:36,900
Because there are two different things. He was not deciding the action.

992
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:42,611
He was deciding whether there was a genuine issue.

993
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:51,036
Yes a genuine issue about whether or not the coins were "goods" that had to be declared.

994
01:39:55,676 --> 01:39:58,270
that the action ... [unintelligible]

995
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:05,229
that a review was requested, so he had to find whether the review would be

996
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,907
I think we understand your point.

997
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,963
What I didn't mention is that in order?

998
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:19,921
My point is that the Minister's Decision is not intelligible

999
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:30,359
and this alone should have been ground to find that the decision should be set aside even before looking at whether the goods.
That is all I have.

1000
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,500
You didn't need an extra adjournment.

1001
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,300
Well, that is all I can say in the time that I've been given.

1002
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:41,200
Yes, and that's been... you've covered all your points.

1003
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:47,900
So thank you very much. You've done very well and you will have a short time for replaying after you hear the other

1004
01:40:48,191 --> 01:40:48,897
Okay?

1005
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:49,743
Thank you.

1006
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,200
So, Your Honor in terms of the amendment appeal

1007
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:01,500
If you've read the Crowns memorandum of fact and law.

1008
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:17,582
He issue is really covered all very squarely by the decision of this Court in [Taleb?] and I don't propose to take you through it that sets out the standard of review very clearly. And in fact, this case rests squarely on the [Taleb?] case.

1009
01:41:17,672 --> 01:41:20,587
is the only case that cited for the proposition

1010
01:41:20,591 --> 01:41:31,041
was the judge looking at the, prospect of success under 221(a) or was he looking at it under another

1011
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:36,200
So the Crown submission is that the standard of review would apply to both.

1012
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:40,913
As either A or B and so in this case.

1013
01:41:40,893 --> 01:41:50,822
No, but it's not a question of standard of review, the question is Messieur advanced that you cannot look at evidence

1014
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:55,267
I'm not sure that it's right, without evidence, that was the point

1015
01:41:55,300 --> 01:42:10,700
So no evidence is required to a uphold Justice Gleeson's decision that the Amendments have no Prospect of success. He was entitled to look at the the pleadings on their face the proposed amendments without getting into any evidence beyond that

1016
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:12,500
and that was your position before.

1017
01:42:12,886 --> 01:42:13,486
Yes

1018
01:42:13,423 --> 01:42:16,412
reading the pleadings per se.

1019
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:22,136
It was enough to come a "no reasonable prospect on the cause of action" to strike

1020
01:42:22,311 --> 01:42:24,311
Yes

1021
01:42:29,122 --> 01:42:32,337
It was like a 221(1)(a)

1022
01:42:32,386 --> 01:42:33,469
Yes.

1023
01:42:36,366 --> 01:42:37,009
Okay

1024
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:48,784
And then, with respect to the second appeal for summary judgement the test of course is set very clearly that Justice Gleason was to consider the test in Hryniak and Mauldin

1025
01:42:48,835 --> 01:42:56,469
 that case also sets out the standard of overview for this court, an appellate review, at the first level or the second level

1026
01:42:56,614 --> 01:43:10,423
In fact, it deals with the appellate review at the Supreme Court level.
The Crown submission is that that same standard applies in this court in dealing with motion for summary judgment where the Federal Court deals with it

1027
01:43:10,533 --> 01:43:13,906
by a judge, rather than a prothonotary at first instance

1028
01:43:13,872 --> 01:43:18,790
What I don't understand in your motion is,
first you make it under 221

1029
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,600
You agree that 221 is a motion to strike.

1030
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,700
Yes

1031
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:29,027
215 is the Rule for the summary judgement, so, and

1032
01:43:30,417 --> 01:43:42,965
frankly, I have some difficulty and that's why I'm raising it just speaking for myself at this stage and we haven't decided in anything but I have some difficulty with the argument.

1033
01:43:44,138 --> 01:43:53,109
that you cannot have an Action that would include different parts

1034
01:43:53,276 --> 01:44:01,190
and the whole pupose, if it were true that you have to have 135 on its own

1035
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:17,500
Then, I don't see under what authority one would strike, completely kill the other parts, rather than remove them and separate them as different Action.
There you would have to you know, maybe bring a motion to strike under 221.

1036
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:26,397
Either because no reasonable cause or prejudice and whatever, if you want to have evidence, but you can't do

1037
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:41,566
I just can't understand why you say I'm going to strike other claims just because you feel that 135 should be on its own. It's like substance over... form over substance.

1038
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:54,052
The Crown did bring a motion to strike and that was dismissed by Prothonotary Milczynski, she suggested that a motion for summary judgement might be more appropriate.

1039
01:44:54,146 --> 01:44:58,650
And your motion to strike was in respect to which portion of the action?

1040
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:09,100
Again, related to the question of law simply boiled down to whether the conduct at issue could be resolved by determining whether the coins are "goods" or not.

1041
01:45:09,066 --> 01:45:17,463
But how can that be determinative of the other claims included?

1042
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:23,313
Because that is the only conduct that was at issue in the Plaintiff's claim

1043
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:29,747
Let's have a look and explain it to us, because I don't see it when I read the Statement of Claim.

1044
01:45:29,712 --> 01:45:38,603
Of course.
The claim can be framed however a plaintiff wishes and it can be very expansive particularly where the plaintiff is acting in person.

1045
01:45:38,695 --> 01:45:49,002
but nonetheless the only issue that the Federal Court will consider is the question of, in this case, whether the coins are "goods"

1046
01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:59,761
 and Justice Gleeson was very clear about that point, that section... the Customs Act provides a very limited review in this... It's not really an ordinary action at all.

1047
01:45:59,901 --> 01:46:03,131
 It's a statutory appeal by way of Action

1048
01:46:03,131 --> 01:46:04,500
You're changing course here.

1049
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:05,583
key to

1050
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:17,300
this would be the key question to all the claims because my question to you is not whether you can put them in the same proceeding which is procedural. Okay?

1051
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:22,800
What courts do when things are put together, that should not be put together,

1052
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:25,300
we separate them

1053
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,600
They don't just strike it.

1054
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Unless there is no merit, but you have to have a motion looking at the merit of the other stuff.

1055
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:48,052
If you're saying to me and that's what I heard that this one question was determinative of all of the other claims, that's a different story, but I couldn't see it when I read it

1056
01:46:48,892 --> 01:46:56,015
When I read the Statement of Claim, it was not evident to me, maybe just because I didn't see it, you know.

1057
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:59,089
you can say that

1058
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,759
That one question. Are they "goods"?

1059
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,700
Is enough to determine the merits of all the other claims?

1060
01:47:07,918 --> 01:47:15,015
I take your point, but obviously Justice Gleeson felt differently, and the Crown supports his position.

1061
01:47:15,038 --> 01:47:16,305
But that's why we're a Court of Appeal!

1062
01:47:16,305 --> 01:47:19,272
Okay, so that he thinks differently is another story

1063
01:47:19,378 --> 01:47:29,108
and the Crown submits that the only issue that required any review whatsoever, whether it's by summary judgment or at a trial,

1064
01:47:29,112 --> 01:47:34,200
of the Plaintiff's claim was whether the coins are "goods"

1065
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:41,200
I assume that you tried to convince him of that. So now is your time to practice convince us

1066
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,900
But that's the point here

1067
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:49,376
if the coins are not "goods", then clearly the defendant loses the case. Full stop.

1068
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:51,845
and if the coins are "goods"

1069
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:57,138
What else is available to my friend under a statutory appeal if this is not an Action

1070
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:58,900
You would lose what case?

1071
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:14,369
You would lose the case for punitive damages,
you would lose the case for Declaration that the Minister of Public Safety has a policy aiding crime and terrorism in Canada,
what would you be losing?

1072
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:36,300
I think it's fair to say that Justice Gleeson felt that there was no prospect of success for those claims. There may not have been a specific motion before him at the time to strike those claims, but a motion had as I said in brought previously to strike and had been dismissed.

1073
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,164
So that's not very good for you.

1074
01:48:39,319 --> 01:48:50,470
what I mean is that it's not a judge looking at a claim without a motion.
because there is another party. We have an adversarial, so somebody,

1075
01:48:50,692 --> 01:49:02,600
In this case, Mr. Hociung has the right to present his argument as to whether to be struck.

1076
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:03,459
Yes. So

1077
01:49:03,483 --> 01:49:05,451
you can't start from there

1078
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:27,691
If the court disagrees with Justice Gleeson that those ancillary claims should not have been struck then if you if you follow through on that proposition, then you can make a determination on the motion for summary judgement whether the coins are "goods" and allow the rest of the claims to proceed and send it back to Federal Court and rest assured my client will move to strike.

1079
01:49:27,801 --> 01:49:41,321
Okay, but you see my point. You just ...
We're a court of law. You can't say "Ok, we're going to take shortcuts because we don't want people to spend money for nothing". We just can't do that.

1080
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,112
I take your point

1081
01:49:43,316 --> 01:49:45,971
and here, it may well be that you're right

1082
01:49:48,176 --> 01:49:52,657
but I just can't see how you can strike other claims without even looking at their merit

1083
01:49:53,661 --> 01:50:07,444
okay, and your argument about 135, you see my point.
If you had struck or sought under 106 to separate those

1084
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:13,225
then you'd be fine, but I don't see how you ...

1085
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:18,105
I just and I'm not talking for my colleague, just me, so convinced me.

1086
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:25,212
you know, if you think you can, but procedure. He has a 135

1087
01:50:25,249 --> 01:50:25,849
Yes,

1088
01:50:25,901 --> 01:50:33,853
he has a write of action maybe for damages and for whatnot.
Maybe he's wrong. Maybe he's gonna lose, he has no case, or whatever.

1089
01:50:34,353 --> 01:50:38,358
but we can't just say because put them in the same Statement of Claim

1090
01:50:38,598 --> 01:50:41,026
[unintelligible] ... time barred

1091
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:50,610
Well, for sure, for a case whether the ruled that the coins are "goods", it's difficult to conceive that he would have a case for punitive damages

1092
01:50:50,702 --> 01:50:55,470
Because he hasn't alleged that he was mistreated in any way by border officers

1093
01:50:55,453 --> 01:50:57,653
Then you'll have an easy job on the motion to strike

1094
01:50:57,706 --> 01:50:58,484
Yes.

1095
01:50:58,499 --> 01:51:07,287
Okay. Now, have you considered, and do you have something [unintelligible] I'm in a bind because I don't know the case at this stage

1096
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:11,606
is the Crown under 3(1)(b)

1097
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:16,400
from your understanding is vicariously responsible for fraud

1098
01:51:16,435 --> 01:51:18,468
So this is on [unintelligible]

1099
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:22,700
So that would be easy for you to produce cases.

1100
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:28,977
And Messieur has until June 6

1101
01:51:29,129 --> 01:51:29,649
June 7th

1102
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:32,000
June 7th, so many days do you need to

1103
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,200
as many as you [unintelligible], but I don't need much time.

1104
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:41,700
So an extra two days because you'll start looking now, of course, so by the 9th,

1105
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:43,175
yes.

1106
01:51:51,893 --> 01:51:53,211
so that is done...

1107
01:51:53,276 --> 01:51:55,276
and you realize that

1108
01:51:56,237 --> 01:51:59,359
and I'm raising this for both sides

1109
01:51:59,351 --> 01:52:05,950
if we were to say that the rest has to go back

1110
01:52:05,968 --> 01:52:20,188
there may be a jurisdiction problem and a time limitation problem.
Time limitation if it is within 106, and if it is not within 106

1111
01:52:20,206 --> 01:52:32,974
you can still have a cause of action against the officer, but if that is so, this court has no jurisdiction.
I'm just raising this so you know.

1112
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:46,745
that when we send it back, there may be a lot more hurdle under other than reasonable cause of action on its face just because of the wording in the communication and whatnot.

1113
01:52:47,429 --> 01:52:48,097
Yes.

1114
01:52:48,097 --> 01:52:49,900
Okay, you're all following on that.

1115
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:50,800
I am. Yes,

1116
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:51,371
okay.

1117
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:57,700
Okay. Now you want to say anything else about the Amendments or are you

1118
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:05,300
102, Mr Hociung raised a lot of error

1119
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:06,400
Yes

1120
01:53:06,421 --> 01:53:11,821
You made a statement that the ancilliary thing should not have been struck

1121
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:14,491
Can you show me where they were struck?

1122
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:17,166
They weren't stuck. It's just that ...

1123
01:53:17,157 --> 01:53:21,207
We usually make a comment that it should not have been struck. Couldn't find where it actually

1124
01:53:21,265 --> 01:53:30,723
So in fact, no, that's correct, your Honour. They were not actually struck.
He simply decided the issue about whether the coins are "goods"

1125
01:53:30,738 --> 01:53:38,549
and then of [unintelligible] whether the coins are are "currency" and subject to his findings, he decided to dismiss the entire action.

1126
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:39,900
with he didn't strike it

1127
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:45,202
he dismissed the action

1128
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:47,800
You realize how it becomes very important.

1129
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:57,900
Yes, you would have to find that the ruling on coins as "goods" and "currency" was determinative of all the claims in the plaintiff's claim.

1130
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:02,583
or that procedure form

1131
01:54:04,410 --> 01:54:05,402
Yes.

1132
01:54:05,489 --> 01:54:13,782
override the substance and you can just dismiss because you happen to put it on in the same Statement of Claim

1133
01:54:15,647 --> 01:54:16,982
Yes.

1134
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:37,490
So, in the Federal Court, the crown took the position that the coins are "goods", Justice Gleeson found that they are both "goods" and "currency" and on appeal to this Court, the crown is happy to support Justice Gleeson's ruling on both those points.

1135
01:54:38,121 --> 01:55:04,597
The Crown referred to several pieces of legislation before Justice Gleeson; The Crown repeats those submissions, but in addition the Crown is relying on the Customs Tariff, which I cited in the memorandum as well as two cases decided under the federal Export and Import Permits Act.
Both are fairly old cases, but they made their point of

1136
01:55:04,598 --> 01:55:09,721
But we're looking that... just a second.

1137
01:55:09,946 --> 01:55:25,200
In my own mind the first one I would like you to clarify if you can is the proposition that if something there's no tax to be paid, it doesn't need to be declared unless there's an obligation to declare under another Act

1138
01:55:25,832 --> 01:55:26,594
Right.

1139
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:27,901
Can you start with that?

1140
01:55:27,976 --> 01:55:40,111
That it's absolutely false; if a good exceeds the limit allowed for perfect goods purchased abroad during the trip to be declared it must be

1141
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:48,664
Absolutely must be reported. Even if there's no tax is to be paid on it in terms of custom duties because there may be GST.

1142
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:53,205
Okay. So where do we have that provision that says "if you exceed you..."

1143
01:55:53,208 --> 01:55:56,667
you're talking about the $800 for 48 hours

1144
01:55:56,734 --> 01:55:57,244
Yes, that's all it is.

1145
01:55:57,257 --> 01:55:59,488
Where do we have that provision?

1146
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:05,000
So you're looking for the specific provision in the Customs Act

1147
01:56:05,432 --> 01:56:10,303
yes, because you say that what he says is false

1148
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,142
easy to find it

1149
01:56:13,191 --> 01:56:18,991
so I reproduced provisions of the Customs act that the end of my

1150
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:24,070
memorandum, but those particular Provisions would

1151
01:56:24,489 --> 01:56:26,377
out in the regulations, which

1152
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:27,466
as you

1153
01:56:27,847 --> 01:56:31,047
not believe I have reproduced in full.

1154
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:36,100
So I would have to provide that to you subsequently.

1155
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,661
We have the Custom Tariff,

1156
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:40,872
Yes.

1157
01:56:41,397 --> 01:56:42,527
[unintelligible]

1158
01:56:42,571 --> 01:56:43,211
no

1159
01:56:43,311 --> 01:56:47,149
because you do realize that that was one of his main arguments.

1160
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:47,300
throughout

1161
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:50,600
it's not an interior.

1162
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:59,300
Well, it's a bit of a surprise argument for that. It's just because there is no Duty owing a good doesn't have to be reported.

1163
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:11,700
For example, let's take it the keys out of this case. If the ghosts are currency if their value is an excessive 10,000 dollars

1164
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:12,800
Express seat.

1165
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,800
Yes, they have to be reported but there's no taxable on those.

1166
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:18,400
Yes, but I think what the shoes

1167
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,800
yes,

1168
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:26,400
there could be a series of other stations.

1169
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:34,200
so

1170
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:42,039
We need something tangible other than it makes no it's false. So.

1171
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:46,841
I thought that that argument was raised in the

1172
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:49,723
Apellant's memorandum

1173
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:56,736
It is, but I mean, are you asking for this citation to the regulation that

1174
01:57:56,750 --> 01:58:00,915
Yes, I want a piece of evidence [unintelligible] or something or

1175
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,444
Do you have a case?

1176
01:58:02,444 --> 01:58:03,500
There's no case.

1177
01:58:03,528 --> 01:58:06,401
Ok, there's no case, then something other than your word?

1178
01:58:06,868 --> 01:58:16,257
What I could do, what I can offer to the court, is
when the time comes for me to send in the case law on the fraud of the public servant

1179
01:58:16,248 --> 01:58:22,257
I can provide as well to reference to the specific provision in the regulation that deals with a specific limits.

1180
01:58:22,291 --> 01:58:27,999
We don't want to extend this overly, so if you could provide that within...

1181
01:58:28,085 --> 01:58:35,286
... until, before the next Wedesday which is the time that Messieur is coming back from wherever,

1182
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:39,651
then he can answer about this in his letter

1183
01:58:39,758 --> 01:58:45,026
that provides the answer for 3(1)(b) of the Crown Liability

1184
01:58:45,059 --> 01:58:47,713
fraud cover or not, you follow me?

1185
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:57,913
The second section will be whatever you have to say about the regulation that is being raised in the okay.

1186
01:58:58,098 --> 01:59:03,700
This is not a memorandum. Okay, all this must not be more than five pages.

1187
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,985
all this
Ok... very well.

1188
01:59:08,238 --> 01:59:10,564
But to apply that...

1189
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:16,527
I just want that to be put in the minutes

1190
01:59:18,953 --> 01:59:20,513
The 29th

1191
01:59:21,507 --> 01:59:25,702
Perfect.

1192
01:59:27,045 --> 01:59:38,385
[unintelligible]

1193
01:59:38,485 --> 01:59:47,093
you say in your view, everything that is over the limit must be declared, whether or not there is taxation

1194
01:59:47,332 --> 01:59:53,599
... but how can it be over the limit if there is no tax on it?

1195
01:59:53,800 --> 02:00:11,300
Because he.. the plaintiff paid, and this is uncontradicted in the evidence, USD $2700, for these ... USD $5700 for these coins when in fact that represented 29.5 times their face value.

1196
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:12,500
So

1197
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:20,600
So there's an obligation to disclose it just because it was over is exemption, whether or not there was tax on it.

1198
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:29,300
OK. And are you going to address your interpretation of those provisions that you push us through?

1199
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:30,513
Yes.

1200
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:37,000
Unless you have any further questions. Those are always missions.

1201
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:49,100
So the provisions that you asked about the regulations the limits.

1202
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:30,500
well lady I have I mean I can take you through Justice Gleason's decision and detail, but the Supreme Court of Canada has said that you know, the

1203
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:37,100
Pellet report does not need to conduct the same analysis that was conducted by the federal.

1204
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:39,300
Sorry. This is a question of milk.

1205
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:41,100
Yes question of no. Yes.

1206
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:45,100
Okay. So are we here that some question of North Korea's?

1207
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:45,500
Yes.

1208
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:49,700
Okay, so why are not are we not conducting it ourselves?

1209
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:55,400
So his question was that Justice Gleason is arguments that Justice.

1210
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:07,300
just because that particular section is not referred to expressly Injustice and the decision doesn't mean that that

1211
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:11,800
Legislation was cited to him act was before him.

1212
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:13,500
he

1213
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:21,400
refer to numerous pieces of legislation in his decision dealing with currently.

1214
02:02:55,400 --> 02:03:00,500
So let's say you had drugs manure and decides to bring back its.

1215
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:03,600
under 1000 and by the

1216
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:06,900
$1 bill that are over

1217
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:09,900
VIP that it doesn't have to be carried up.

1218
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:14,700
Yes, because he has to declare it as good. It's not money laundering. It's

1219
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:19,200
you bring the flowing hair dollar coin, which I

1220
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:34,800
Refer to my memory and there's a picture of it at the back of my book of authorities. If you brought that and brought it into Canada, you would have to declare it as a good because purchased it. Well, the last time it was bought it was bought for 10 million dollars US.

1221
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:44,100
You don't have to declare it under the proceeds of finding money longer. Yeah, because the face value is less than 10000 dollars Canadian.

1222
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:54,700
Declared only as a good the proceeds Act only comes into play if the face value of the money that may or may not be longer is over 10,000 dollars.

1223
02:03:57,100 --> 02:04:11,800
And what about if that's right, then you can put to the bank or in your I'm just I'm just puzzled by the fact that you don't think that people have to declare.

1224
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:12,500
Well

1225
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:16,700
the million dollar they bring in it's just because it's on Facebook.

1226
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:30,200
Yes. I understand really the money laundering provisions of the process of climactic not apply to collectible coins that have a very low face value but a very high fair market value.

1227
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:46,100
It's like bringing in diamonds. The proceeds act just doesn't apply in terms of money ordering even though a drug Smuggler or a terrorist can bring one diamond and it's easily over ten thousand dollars. It's different legislation that applies to catch that.

1228
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:52,600
precedes Act only applies to the implication of actual currency and only

1229
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:02,000
I would have to check but I believe.

1230
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:08,500
Well, no.

1231
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:11,300
we have a judgment that

1232
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:12,900
based on that and we don't have we

1233
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:16,300
have the provision that is an issue whether but we don't have

1234
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:22,000
we don't have the entire act before the court in my in my local history.

1235
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:23,700
And yeah, but

1236
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:25,500
yeah the specific provision.

1237
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:39,600
So the reporting that if we know can react phase but

1238
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:43,900
it is understood by the Water Service officers that they are to buy that.

1239
02:05:50,900 --> 02:06:05,000
Yes, I mean it's suitable you could have old Canadian dollar bills that are worth much more than one dollar right now, but still with not be within the 10,000 11 without me over. They don't have to be declared.

1240
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:14,500
Because of their Facebook but if the terrorists goes to sell it, you know and pains more than 10,000 dollars. Obviously. That's a problem.

1241
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:29,200
Respect of the Declaration for good and money. Yes.

1242
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:33,600
And you rely on your written submission?

1243
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:34,100
Yes.

1244
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:35,800
And that's

1245
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:45,700
well look in terms of the question. You asked me did the Justice please and consider section 11 of the currency actors to take one of my friends arguments.

1246
02:06:46,400 --> 02:07:00,100
At paragraph 50 of Justice Gleason's reasons for decision the votes almost a page and a half of his reasons for decision to citing Section 8, for example, the Customs Act.

1247
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:08,700
I simply want to raise the point that the game that he simply because he hasn't specifically cited section 11 doesn't mean he didn't

1248
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:10,700
considered.

1249
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:12,300
Yes.

1250
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:38,600
Yes, so is there something wrong in this video?

1251
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:42,300
No.

1252
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,800
I don't think I'm following it. But

1253
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:55,600
let's look at paragraph 65 to judge is the plaintiff has not argued that the coins have found to be good. For example.

1254
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:05,000
I see what your pointing as whether or not

1255
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,700
yes. Yes.

1256
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:09,700
Absolutely accurate on that point.

1257
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:10,600
I

1258
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:17,500
would have to take you to his notice his written representations file in response to the motion for summary judgment.

1259
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:19,400
So let's look at

1260
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:34,600
That problem with my book on page.

1261
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,400
factor for the people

1262
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:49,900
above value 1 in 102 Dash 18

1263
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:56,200
to look at

1264
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:03,600
I think you're saying it should be it should be page 121.

1265
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:09,400
Okay that can you look at your book and it may be one page

1266
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:12,700
1214.

1267
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:47,400
No.

1268
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:54,900
anyway

1269
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:04,000
Whether or not the judge accepted as if

1270
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,900
an issue exactly yes. Yes, that's the point of situation way

1271
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:12,900
and you don't have nine and tell us if you think it's the same argument that they've got 65

1272
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:16,400
because maybe it's not the same argument.

1273
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:22,900
Well, the

1274
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:24,700
plaintiff has been admitted.

1275
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:25,500
the evidence

1276
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:33,900
Is paid 5700 us for the points? So clearly that if the coins are good that would trigger the reporting requirements.

1277
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:56,300
So what do we have at 9?

1278
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:08,500
But now we're talking about the difference in nine we're talking about.

1279
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,700
which is a neighboring which

1280
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:25,400
you can section 12 1 of the question Act.

1281
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:33,300
All Goods that are important shawl except in such circumstances subject that may be prescribed the reported to the news.

1282
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:35,900
So all Goods that are important.

1283
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:38,600
Yes, so

1284
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:40,700
you're saying that argument?

1285
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:47,600
I think that argument must have been made to the judge because the

1286
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:53,400
pleaded that he paid an amount and accessibility allowable limit not to report

1287
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:56,600
so we did Judge and spoke when he says the argument.

1288
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:01,300
It's possible, but I don't see that anything turns

1289
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:01,500
out.

1290
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:08,400
Okay, that's yes.

1291
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:20,000
I didn't anticipate that the plaintiff is going to take issue with something on this with respect to this particular sentence in just

1292
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:22,700
That point in his memorandum.

1293
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:27,100
Okay, so that board has nothing to remember and food.

1294
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,100
and it's not

1295
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:32,700
Okay, I don't see anything turning on.

1296
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:51,100
Okay. The next point was a paragraph 68.

1297
02:12:55,700 --> 02:13:01,300
The reference to the fact that there are overlapping for vision in itself shows.

1298
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:21,600
Just the mere fact that they're open up does not mean that there's a conflict and what Justice Gleason did was review all of the different pieces of relevant legislation very clearly and crafts together.

1299
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:28,400
The clear the clear proposition that could that point these collector coins are votes.

1300
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:45,600
There was no easy answer for him. There was no definition of money in any of his eyes, but by looking at all of the piece of legislation, which he has carefully sited at length in his long decision. He found as a fact that points are Goods.

1301
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:48,400
Yeah, that's a matter of law.

1302
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:49,000
Yes.

1303
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:56,700
There is no restructure.

1304
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:03,900
Okay, the next point that was raised and

1305
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:16,800
the happiness argues that this question knowing was not a knot and the judge at also consider.

1306
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:21,800
whether the decision under appeal was otherwise

1307
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:36,300
the federal court on the motion for southern was to the term and whether the coins were Goods or currency or both.

1308
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:43,000
An outcome of that determination was determinate of the entire statutory appeal.

1309
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:47,600
There was no need to allow any of the other claims to proceed.

1310
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:50,600
And Justice League so far.

1311
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:57,400
And the ministerial decision to be clear was not.

1312
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:10,700
Technically something that he judicially reviewed. This is a statue of action. So Justice Gleason technically did not need to consider the ministerial decision Beyond its actual outcome

1313
02:15:10,700 --> 02:15:11,800
because it's you know,

1314
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:12,200
yes.

1315
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:15,900
What different evidence?

1316
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:16,400
Yes.

1317
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:19,800
Okay.

1318
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:55,900
Yes,

1319
02:15:55,900 --> 02:15:57,100
so you're not

1320
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:57,800
no,

1321
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:58,600
okay.

1322
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:14,500
Whatever the merits you have to go by the rules,

1323
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:14,800
absolutely.

1324
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Okay, I think.

1325
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:28,900
We're talking when you type of the goods that have been reported you say there was ahead and reported with those internet of your attention.

1326
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:37,900
Doctor said first referred to percentage of your personal limitation personal exemption.

1327
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:12,400
You have to disclose that he's bought Goods, but they did not subject to the reporting requirements under the Customs. Act was the first person's Act.

1328
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,000
Yes, see instead of buying.

1329
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:56,100
minute on the form? Yes, but if you're actually asked this was a land Crossing if you're asked by the Border Services officers squarely having purchased anything abroad technically. You should say I haven't purchased anything over that you

1330
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:52,400
did not like authorities, but I will provide

1331
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:59,700
And in the first instance, you did say each part you better in it.

1332
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:00,300
Don't go. Yes.

1333
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:04,200
Success was clearly divided before Justice.

1334
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:07,800
Thank you.

1335
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,400
Reply is just about what to say.

1336
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:14,700
Okay.

1337
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:27,900
However there my friend made quite a few actually responded but quite a few points. I'd like to start with 101 the amendment here.

1338
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:38,900
Was relied on her neck in order to drive.

1339
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:42,000
the principles under which

1340
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:47,100
amendment may be struck her up is was

1341
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:49,800
he can't this is in your memory?

1342
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:10,600
the amendment

1343
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:17,700
to refuse the interfuse the amendment. Yes, and you've already told us about the jurisprudence.

1344
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:26,000
Yes, however, several would not apply just don't do the Supreme Court and

1345
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,500
whatnot. So why it wouldn't apply

1346
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:35,600
developed because it was guidance for summary judgment motions. Not for many emotions.

1347
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:36,600
Perfect next.

1348
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:37,600
next

1349
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:45,600
my friend said

1350
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:57,600
That did not allow this treatment, which is not correct. One of those specific claims is against popular debut for threats and

1351
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:03,200
try to yes, and then you you're saying

1352
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:14,300
Okay.

1353
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:38,400
Here there's fun. Also missed submissions about them limitations for officers or and you know Honor made a point about the hurdles.

1354
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:45,900
of having time limitations fortunately, in this case the timers of limitations have not even started

1355
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:46,700
we

1356
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:50,300
what do you

1357
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:52,900
find Farmers have not started the

1358
02:22:54,700 --> 02:23:01,800
Individuals are still expecting this Ransom payment for Return of the money. So that means that the

1359
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:06,200
fraught is continuing its not a finished transaction.

1360
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:07,500
Oh,

1361
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:08,100
it has not

1362
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:12,600
the judge didn't determined anything.

1363
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:14,400
No, that was a point. So

1364
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:22,100
you don't need to reply. I'm just I think we were discussing what you need to face later down the road if we return it.

1365
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:51,800
And about the basic section exemptions, there's fun and mix the arc the daily that respond makes the argument that some of the exemptions that come under schedule 3 of the exact Tax Act to apply which are the exemptions with respect to time spent outside the 800 dollars per day.

1366
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:52,600
Yes. Yeah.

1367
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:09,400
There are some exceptions with respecting

1368
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:30,600
my point my reply is that the same exemptions or the exemptions that that he refers to come from the same place as the exemption for coin they all come from schedule 3. So the point is if there is an exemption for time spent outside of Canada. This would be equally for all the other

1369
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:31,500
heels.

1370
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,900
is going to give us the regulation and you're gonna have

1371
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:49,200
so that's when it's easy to put their

1372
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:53,800
very well.

1373
02:24:56,400 --> 02:25:04,200
the respondent also stated at 8 that he wouldn't he would be happy that a Smuggler would declare a large sum of

1374
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:08,700
gold coins as goods and this

1375
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,400
however, he said

1376
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:25,500
I believe he said that depending on the amount of gold coins, there would have to be reported. However, they retired the drive of the upstairs apartment. Was that no amount?

1377
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:28,200
that there is no amount of

1378
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:32,900
no prescribed amount for coins know

1379
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:35,400
we're just we're not talking about the president.

1380
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:43,900
No amount of gold coins would have to be reported.

1381
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:46,000
No, he said they would have to be

1382
02:25:47,500 --> 02:25:56,600
so that's one section and then he didn't say that he said

1383
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:02,500
contradicts

1384
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:24,600
himself by saying that there is a limit and for the proceeds act the cbsa and is India and the evidence before the judge. There's a memo about precious metals where coins such as these and other financial instruments that are gold bars for example are not to be reported.

1385
02:26:25,700 --> 02:26:28,200
Okay, we cannot exist in the appears.

1386
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:42,700
to the precious metals

1387
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:57,000
and what is the temperature

1388
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:01,500
next exercise document?

1389
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:03,800
says that

1390
02:27:04,900 --> 02:27:05,100
that

1391
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:09,100
currency gold and silver precious metals

1392
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:32,400
So it's just in a different appeal.

1393
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:33,800
It is in both the Army.

1394
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:41,700
Okay, and that would be too I was actually document. So what is it that you're saying is a contradiction of what you said

1395
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:46,100
so that internal memo is trucks. Simply say officers is

1396
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:46,600
where

1397
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:49,500
No.

1398
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:50,400
because

1399
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:18,800
your page 100 of the appeal book, which is the second page of the metal.

1400
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:25,400
first second page of the mouth

1401
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:42,200
coins are also to be treated as goods and not as currency and not the word not is underlying.

1402
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:49,700
The last sentence of that of that paragraph says across border currency and monitor instrument report, which is formed

1403
02:28:49,700 --> 02:28:56,800
Easton this as anything it's a characteristic kitchen. How does that have to do with the procedure?

1404
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:06,000
Because it instructs the last sentence instructs officers. Do not require reporting under the monetary instrument.

1405
02:29:07,900 --> 02:29:08,900
regulations

1406
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:11,200
of course border currencies

1407
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:20,900
and that is without regard to the amount.

1408
02:29:54,100 --> 02:30:07,000
So I would give one minute after you're done for an answer from the other side because normally these things that are already raised by you have to be raised all in the first time around.

1409
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,900
I'm sorry, that's high pressure that I would like under.

1410
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:14,600
Yes. Pretty good. Okay. So with the next Point

1411
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:17,600
next point that makes is that

1412
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:33,900
that declaring financial instruments and gold currency under the Customs act would be sufficient reported. Even if they wanted is large such as a terrorist or a Smuggler the problem is that they

1413
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:55,300
The two reporting regimes address different names the person that reports go to the fin track organization, which is able to track and find patterns and financial movement. Whereas customers report only go to Industry Canada populations to find out generally how our economy is doing so a report

1414
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:59,600
First the Customs act would be would go under the radar.

1415
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:02,400
And they will not be able to.

1416
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:11,500
To find okay, but it has really not

1417
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:12,400
much application.

1418
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:16,600
Your case,

1419
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:20,500
I believe I believe this is exactly what the cbsa is trying to do

1420
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:22,700
know because you're under 1000.

1421
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,200
It doesn't apply to my case

1422
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,400
know it's what I'm saying.

1423
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:29,600
It doesn't apply to my four points, but my client that is

1424
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:36,600
a that's not

1425
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:43,100
the point next point.

1426
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:53,500
No, he said that you make the argument

1427
02:31:53,500 --> 02:32:05,400
is what would have been determinative and his

1428
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:17,500
About the Cog about the conflict.

1429
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:20,200
Where we're just glisten.

1430
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:29,500
Their Spanish says that there is international conflict. However it paragraph 72 of the decision just released him says there's no real content.

1431
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:34,400
And that implies that there is a conflict is just not to be seen as real.

1432
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:34,900
Yeah.

1433
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:56,500
The other with respect to the novel treatment of the of the case the denominator treatment applies to the action as a whole which means that every every claim in the action has to be considered the novel.

1434
02:32:57,100 --> 02:32:57,800
It doesn't mean that

1435
02:32:57,800 --> 02:33:00,100
the rest of the reaction was never before

1436
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:01,800
it's

1437
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:02,400
the first time.

1438
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:07,000
Yes. However, it doesn't mean that the

1439
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:27,100
appeal is expected section 135 needs to be determined the novel and even if it did if the judge had a lot of 35 from the beginning there was no evidence before and what's the weather of any contravention? There was no evidence of what was or was not important.

1440
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:30,600
the next

1441
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:43,600
there's all I have on

1442
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:49,300
how to and then I correct that it was not disputed that you did not declare those comments.

1443
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:49,700
Correct?

1444
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:52,600
It's not descriptive than they were fine.

1445
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:57,300
Or what their face value was and what their purchases?

1446
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:14,900
which is the officer that the search and the finding that he noted at the very end that he understands that the coins are technically currents, but

1447
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:22,400
he needs to treat him as Goods because of this metal. That is right.

1448
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:43,300
I would like yes, I do. Of course. Yes.

1449
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:51,200
You're not annoying. So, you know except for you this version and things like that.

1450
02:34:52,600 --> 02:35:06,800
Well your honor in the evening the motion to strike at the responded mate earlier in the case. I still have mental to time.

1451
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:40,000
Make the submission together with the others check my favorite work. And yes,

1452
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,700
and when you do that you have to put

1453
02:35:45,900 --> 02:35:59,100
it because the respondents conduct has been.

1454
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:09,800
A very heavy-handed and vacation. I like to point out.

1455
02:36:11,100 --> 02:36:11,700
that

1456
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:19,100
before you do this things the judge didn't find anything fixation or anything.

1457
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:21,900
No, I'm making point about costs on the appeal.

1458
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:25,600
Yes, but we haven't seen anything that says before I

1459
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:32,800
like to submit the letter that the respondent submitted to the registry with respect to the elements submission of

1460
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:45,200
Of the memoranda. He lied on the you know lyrics that the registry cleaning that the service was done in properly so far in this case that

1461
02:36:46,100 --> 02:36:51,200
there's bottom has fight every way possible to slow down and to make it more expensive to

1462
02:36:58,500 --> 02:36:59,800
it's all redeemed religious.

1463
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,100
You didn't ask for it. Then you remember and

1464
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:25,200
in my

1465
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:26,700
memorandum

1466
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:28,900
and none of the

1467
02:37:28,900 --> 02:37:30,500
yes,

1468
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:31,200
you know

1469
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:33,800
that's supposed to do for everything about Cooks.

1470
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:52,000
normal costs

1471
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:04,900
Now thank you very much

1472
02:38:04,900 --> 02:38:26,500
sure that bulletin free data Justice League Seasons ruler. It was a thing that during the discovery process prior to the motion for some reason. So obviously that fully would have to be updated with respect to the treatment of currency.

1473
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:28,400
Was it?

1474
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:33,500
It's not before the church

1475
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:34,300
it

1476
02:38:34,300 --> 02:38:36,600
why would it be in the

1477
02:38:36,600 --> 02:38:41,100
pill book? Because the well because the talent

1478
02:38:42,300 --> 02:38:47,600
the appellant has put several documents that were in a veil produced him and Discovery into the book

1479
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:50,800
while you're supposed to object to that.

1480
02:38:54,700 --> 02:38:56,400
yes, well lady he

1481
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:14,900
I did ask for us specific ruling that we'd be allowed to file separate books of authorities just as an example and that was granted. It was Justice Renny. There's a history in this file of not being able to agree on what documents should go into which books

1482
02:39:31,100 --> 02:39:40,400
it wasn't part of the evidence that the plaintiff submitted for his motion to Amendment.

1483
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:53,400
reasons

1484
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:58,400
to the extent that the bulletin

1485
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:00,000
Is

1486
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,100
a part of the evidence?

1487
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:05,800
Not that would have been an affidavit for the motion to strike.

1488
02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:15,400
That's the same. It's not the same work we're looking at what was on the record for the summer judgment motion and emotional

1489
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:19,300
they were different they were different affidavits filed for both.

1490
02:40:19,300 --> 02:40:21,100
So this would not have been

1491
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:21,900
know

1492
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:23,900
what you check your files

1493
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:30,600
the point.

1494
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:41,500
To take away though was the bulletin would have to be corrected. Give him Justice Gleason's ruling on currents.

1495
02:40:42,500 --> 02:40:50,500
Right the whole point here. Is that the bullets and seems to imply that the Border Services officers are not to treat collector coins as currency.

1496
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:56,600
And Justice Gleason in effect change the law. He said it's booked coins and curse.

1497
02:40:56,600 --> 02:40:57,500
Okay.

1498
02:40:59,700 --> 02:41:01,600
So what you're saying is that?

1499
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:05,900
This may have been an internal administrative.

1500
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:07,800
View,

1501
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:08,200
yes.

1502
02:41:09,100 --> 02:41:09,300
but

1503
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:14,200
it's not one that is in sync with the findings of Justice.

1504
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:18,700
Yes, and it predates justice questions through it.

1505
02:41:18,700 --> 02:41:27,100
And that's why I want to make sure that and that would be the sentence is in paragraph 53.

1506
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:29,600
Yes.

1507
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:30,900
because

1508
02:41:32,300 --> 02:41:33,300
they decide not to

1509
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:36,600
and that

1510
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:47,500
okay, so I understand here.

1511
02:41:57,900 --> 02:42:04,200
So thank you very much. We will take this on the reserve. He's

1512
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:14,600
order

1513
02:42:27,100 --> 02:42:28,000
sitting is now concluded.
