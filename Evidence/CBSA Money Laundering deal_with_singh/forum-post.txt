I thought you were in Canada? Why are you driving them across the border? Wouldn't you just have them shipped and avoid these hassles?

According to them, the mint it self has to be a government organization and it doesn't matter if the coin itself is authorized by a government.

Anyone have anything that states otherwise? I think this is about to be a long day....

Per the sheet they showed me, all silver rounds, including sunshine mint (that's the one in their picture) is taxable.
