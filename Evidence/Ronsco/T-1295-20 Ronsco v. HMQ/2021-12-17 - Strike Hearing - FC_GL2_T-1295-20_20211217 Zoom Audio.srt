of uh from on uh submissions from uh the

82
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,280
plaintiff and from the respondent on on

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,159
cost thrown away with respect to the

84
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,200
prior adjournment that's that I might uh

85
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,079
not might I will ask you to speak to

86
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,319
each of you to speak to briefly uh but I

87
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,480
think we'll save that till the end of uh

88
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,799
of the argument today uh and uh give you

89
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,959
a few minutes if there's something you

90
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,319
want to prepare with respect to that

91
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,400
issue but I I haven't I do have some

92
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,280
questions on cost rone away especially

93
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,560
given the fact that uh we're now hearing

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,400
this matter within a relatively short

95
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,520
window uh we're back we're back in front

96
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
of the court in three weeks and uh so I

97
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,720
definitely have some questions with

98
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,639
respect of the quantum that's being

99
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,280
sought and whether or not there actually

100
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,639
is uh uh thrown away costs here given

101
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,120
given the short passage of time or at

102
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
least costs thrown away to the extent

103
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,160
that have been uh been indicated in the

104
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,880
in the plain of submissions so so again

105
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,919
I'd like to hear from you on that and uh

106
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,440
and I'm I'll also be curious as to

107
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
whether not engaged in any further

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,039
discussions given given where we are

109
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,560
right now on that

110
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,680
issue um so that's my one preliminary

111
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,919
matter that I want to flag for you and

112
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,360
as I say I want to hear from uh from

113
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
both of you at the end of uh of the

114
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,320
matter today um

115
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
so before we begin first let me ask if

116
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,479

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,240

start uh to to hear oral submissions in

123
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,880
on this matter I I've read the material

124
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,720
I'm generally familiar with the

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,960
circumstances uh and the the issues that

126
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,600
have been raised in the uh in the claim

127
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,479
and uh and the general positions of the

128
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,120
parties um and uh so so I'm going to

129
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,680

motion to strike portions of the plain

fresh as amended statement of claim um

136
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,039
essentially we seek to strike the

137
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,360
portions of the claim that seek to quash

138
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,440
the cbsa decision that imposed Customs

139
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,600
act duties and interest on the

140
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,319
plaintiff and the portions claiming

141
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,160
damages equivalent to the Customs act

142
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,680
duties and interest General damages and

143
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,280
damages for professional fees incurred

144
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,360
and that includes the ca the claims

145
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,919
based on negligence and on a breach of

146
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,880
public law

147
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,960
duties uh specifically we seek to strike

148
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,080
subparagraphs 1 a to d which are the

149
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,680
portions of the prayer for Relief

150
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,639
seeking these items paragraphs 46 to

151
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,360
60 claiming the various sets of damages

152
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,720
on the basis of parody

153
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,280
honey paragraphs

154
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,039
61-66 claiming the sets of damages on

155
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,599
the basis of a breach of Duty of care in

156
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,560
negligence and paragraph 67 which again

157
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,199
sets out the damages that the plaintiff

158
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,720
seeks the plaintiff brings this action

159
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,199
under Section 135 of the Customs act but

160
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,680
the relief it seeks Falls outside the

161
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,000
limits of that section a claim under 135

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
is limited to challenging a ministerial

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,080
finding that the Customs Act was

164
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,720
breached such that a penalty may be

165
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,599
imposed but aside from falling outside

166
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,360
the limits of a 135 action the claims we

167
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,080
seek struck out are also otherwise

168
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,520
outside this Court's Jurisdiction

169
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,319
disclose no reasonable cause of action

170
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,560
or or constitute an abusive Pro process

171
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,599
and should be struck on that

172
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,319
basis what can remain of the claim if

173
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,120
the defendant is fully successful on

174
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,680
this motion is the essence of the 135

175
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,879
action itself so the challenge to the

176
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,240
ministerial decision upholding the

177
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,159
penalty assessed against the

178
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,400
plaintiff finally we seek an order

179
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,240
providing an extension of time to file

180
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,560
an amended defense in response to uh

181
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,080
whatever remains of the statement of

182
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,639
claim uh I'll give a brief overview of

183
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,039
our submissions before we uh go further

184
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,159
in

185
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,080
depth the essential character the focus

186
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,639
of this claim and the relief sought is a

187
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,400
challenge to the validity of the July

188
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,120
2020 detailed adjustments

189
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,720
statement issued by the

190
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,240
cbsa this is a decision that required

191
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
the pain plaintiff to pay duties on

192
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,280
import importations of goods between

193
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,240
2015 and 2018

194
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,599
the parts of the claim that seek to

195
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,959
overturn the the detailed adjustment

196
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,800
statement referred generally as a

197
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,560
Das and seek damages equivalent to the

198
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,240
duties it imposes should be struck out

199
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,640
because first the court cannot quash the

200
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,040
cbsa decision on an action the court can

201
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,320
only quash a decision by way of judicial

202
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,880
review but second the federal court does

203
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,040
not have jurisdiction to deal with that

204
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,120
request even on judicial review here

205
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,399
given a statutory appeal scheme set up

206
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,880
by the Customs act which requires such a

207
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,399
challenge to go to the

208
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,040
CIT the courts have consistently found

209
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
the scheme ousts the jurisdiction of the

210
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,560
federal court to deal with such

211
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,519
matters and finally Artful pleading

212
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,200
cannot transform Customs act duties

213
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,440
essentially

214
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,480
taxes into damages be it a negligence or

215
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,360
under a breach of public law

216
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,720
duties the plaintiffs claims a those

217
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,360
headings would have the same effect of

218
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,640
nullifying the cbsa

219
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
decision we submit the plan if must

220
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,360
pursue the appeal scheme provided in the

221
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,720
Customs act to challenge the obligation

222
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,800
to pay the duties at

223
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,320
issue the portions of the claim seeking

224
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,240
General damages and damages for

225
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,360
professional fees incurred should also

226
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,160
be struck as disclosing no reasonable

227
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,800
cause of

228
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,880
action first no duty of care is owed to

229
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,560
the plaintiff to ground a claim

230
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,320
negligence in this claim

231
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,880
overall the pleadings of causation and

232
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,839
loss are

233
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,839
deficient and the pl if cannot be

234
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,920
awarded its costs incurred pursuing

235
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,880
various other appeal proceedings as

236
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,720
damages in this

237
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
action that's the outline of our

238
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,160
argument in a nutshell in terms of

239
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,160
structure today my submissions will

240
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,160
focus on uh the background and context

241
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,640
to the plaintiff's claim to the ENT that

242
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,079
it is helpful to you uh justice gleon

243
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,800
including the operation of the Customs

244
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,200
Act and the relevant facts as set out in

245
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,399
the claim and the documents it

246
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,240
references uh I will then make

247
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,440
submissions on why the claims related to

248
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,279
duties imposed by the cbsa should be

249
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,560
struck as outside this Court's

250
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,680
Jurisdiction including the request that

251
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,079
the dask be quashed and the damages

252
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,480
claims as it relates to the amount of

253
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,920
Duties and

254
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,240
interests finally will briefly address

255
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
some of the plaintiff's arguments

256
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,600
related to the potential for a

257
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,120
multiplicity of

258
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,760
proceedings and the assertion that the

259
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,200
issue of Reason to Believe would be

260
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,160
Central to all of

261
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,839
them my colleague Mr Mayor will then

262
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,560
present our submissions on the remainder

263
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,440
of the claims that should be struck the

264
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,639
claims for General damages professional

265
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,240
fees incurred and the general duty of

266
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,040
care issue as it pertains to the claim

267
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
as a

268
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,320
whole he will also address the

269
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,440
plaintiff's EST stopple

270
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,519
argument as you can see there are

271
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,160
several steps to our submissions we

272
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,120
submit that this reflects the fact that

273
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,519
the claim takes something relatively

274
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,720
simple and attempts to make it

275
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
complex we submit that we in the court

276
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,480
shouldn't be dissuaded by the apparent

277
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,600
complexity on this motion to

278
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,440
strike uh as a preliminary context this

279
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,320
action arises out of Customs act duties

280
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,680
and penalties imposed on the plaintiff

281
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,000
by the cbsa on import if I could just

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,440
stop you there mrb and and just who are

283
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,720
you going to take a few minutes and just

284
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
uh make some submissions on the motion

285
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,639
to strike standard what what what

286
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,959
standard I'm applying in law here I will

287
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,079
I can do that I can I can do that first

288
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:18,920
if you prefer you can do it where

289
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,480
wherever you're going to do it but I

290
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,959
would like to hear you on that issue

291
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,760
with respect to particular the ne claims

292
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,639
and the public law Duty claims I I would

293
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,360
like to clearly understand what your

294
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,240
position is with respect to the general

295
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,880
law that applies before we get into the

296
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,040
merits of of those okay well why don't I

297
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,560
go there now since since you're raising

298
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,480
the question

299
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,920
um uh the law on motion to strike is is

300
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,199
generally well known the court can

301
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:44,519
strike out a pleading in whole or in

302
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,160
part if it discloses no reasonable cause

303
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,040
of action and the test for that is

304
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,880
whether it is plain and obvious that the

305
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,320
claim has no chance of success assuming

306
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
the facts set out in the claim to be

307
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,160
true and proven

308
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,680
uh under rule

309
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,880
221 sub1 Suba it is appropriate for the

310
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,680
federal court to strike a statement of

311
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,720
claim for want of

312
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
jurisdiction uh This was done for

313
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,279
example in the verico case uh which just

314
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,639
for your references volume two tab 53 we

315
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,800
don't have to go there but that's where

316
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,360
it is uh of the defendants

317
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,880
book the plaintiff in that case was

318
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,760
unhappy with a tax assessment and

319
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,000
essenti sought to have his claim to a

320
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,600
tax credit adjudicated in the federal

321
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
court through a statement of claim

322
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,240
seeking

323
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,680
damages the Federal Court held that the

324
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,519
essential purpose of the statement of

325
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,920
claim related to a matter in the

326
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,920
exclusive jurisdiction of the tax court

327
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,079
and struck the claim on the basis that

328
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,519
it lacked

329
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,079
jurisdiction that's analogous roughly to

330
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,720
to what we're dealing with here

331
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,680
today uh rule 2211 F also allows the

332
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,680
court to strike parts of a claim that

333
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,000
constitute an abusive

334
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,519
process um we submit that the claim for

335
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,800
an order quashing the Das and the claims

336
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,839
for damages based on the duties and

337
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,000
interest which would effectively nullify

338
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,199
the Das are outside this Court's

339
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,560
Jurisdiction do disclose no reasonable

340
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,199
cause of action and and or an abusive

341
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:26,920
process so those are submissions on the

342
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,560
general tests applicable I'm not sure if

343
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,519
you wanted go further at this point

344
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,399
that's fine thank

345
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,000
you so in terms of just a preliminary

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,079
context of of what this case is about uh

347
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,279
this action arises out of Customs act

348
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,639
duties and penalties imposed on the plff

349
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,600
by the cbsa on importations of certain

350
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,839
Railway

351
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,440
Wheels following an audit the cbsa

352
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,920
required the plff to correct its tariff

353
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,759
classification on Goods imported between

354
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,440
2015 and

355
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,560
2018 which had been incorrectly declared

356
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,560
under a dutyfree tariff item and to pay

357
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,120
the Rel the related duties and interest

358
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,600
um the plaintiff was also required to

359
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
pay a penalty for not having made

360
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,279
corrections to its declarations earlier

361
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,680
when the cbsa says it had a re an

362
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,240
earlier reason to believe that its

363
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,600
declarations were

364
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,600
incorrect uh now J G I was going to take

365
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,199
you the Customs Act

366
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,160
is relatively complex I suppose and and

367
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,959
I was going to it's helpful take you

368
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,639
through the various Provisions but if

369
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,920
it's not helpful I don't want to take up

370
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,319
too much time doing that so I I I ask

371
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:38,279
what would be most I'm generally

372
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,720
familiar with the the Act and the

373
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,360
workings of the ACT um but but I think

374
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,600
it might be helpful for you to uh to

375
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,639
walk me through to make sure that uh

376
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,079
that the provisions and the way your the

377
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,560
position you take with respect to their

378
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,279
operation uh is understood by me okay

379
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,680
fair enough I'll do that then uh uh so

380
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,440
the Customs Act and the Rel

381
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,759
legislation seeks to oversee regulate

382
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,160
and control the crossb movement of

383
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,920
importations of goods it provides for a

384
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,720
voluntary self-reporting scheme to be

385
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
followed by

386
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,240
importers uh they it's it's the

387
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,759
responsibility is on importers to

388
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,560
declare their goods honestly and and

389
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,680
correctly uh the relevant portions of

390
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,680
the Customs act are at volume one tab

391
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,519
two of the defendants book of authority

392
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,680
um and maybe I'll just refer you to them

393
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,399
rather than take you directly to them if

394
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,519
that's the best way to not to take too

395
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:42,079
much time on this um so under Section

396
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,079
32 for goods to be released in Canada

397
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,759
importers are required to account for

398
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,759
the goods and to pay any related duties

399
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,600
this accounting includes declaring the

400
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,360
Tariff classification of the goods it

401
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,440
also includes declaring the goods origin

402
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,199
and value for Duty it's important to

403
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,360
understand that the ACT treats those

404
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,399
things for certain purposes in the same

405
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,759
way so some of the cases we'll be

406
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,039
looking to later will be dealing with

407
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,240
value for Duty as opposed to tariff

408
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,039
classification but in terms of

409
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,600
redeterminations and appeals they're

410
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,439
treated the exact

411
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,959
same uh section

412
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,880
571b sets out that tariff

413
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
classifications be determined in in

414
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,480
accordance with the Customs

415
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,120
tariff and whether duties must be paid

416
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,640
on imported goods depends in part on the

417
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,880
Tariff classification as well as other

418
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,200
factors a cbsa officer May determine the

419
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,480
Tariff classification of goods under

420
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,080
Section 58 sub

421
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,160
one if an officer does not make the

422
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,240
determination subsection 582 says that

423
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,160
the Tariff classification is deemed to

424
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,080
be as declared by the

425
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,720
Importer so an officer can check it and

426
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,679
make the determination or leave it as as

427
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,240
declared by the Importer

428
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,600
that tariff classification can change

429
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,880
after importation in certain

430
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,440
circumstances number one if the Importer

431
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,000
has reason to believe it declared its

432
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,159
declared tariff classification was

433
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,600
incorrect and it files a correction

434
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,440
under Section

435
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,679
32.2 or if the cbsa itself redetermined

436
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,240
the Tariff classification under Section

437
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,559
59 sub

438
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,360
one so first I'll take a look at section

439
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,200
32.2 subsection 2 states that the

440
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,640
Importer shall within 90 days after the

441
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,159
Importer has reason to believe that

442
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,520
their Declaration of tariff

443
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,400
classification is incorrect correct that

444
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,760
declaration and pay any amount owing as

445
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,640
duties and interests as a

446
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,720
result section 32.2

447
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,200
sub4 says that the obligation to do that

448
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,240
to self-correct ends four years after

449
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,360
the goods were originally accounted for

450
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,720
so when they originally

451
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,080
imported in other words for a period of

452
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,480
four years after the goods are imported

453
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,280
the Importer is required to self-correct

454
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,400
declarations tariff

455
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,679
classification pay any additional duties

456
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,440
within 90 days of having reason to

457
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,159
believe its original Declaration was

458
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,280
incorrect and it's not required to do

459
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,200
that after the four-year

460
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,960
period uh section subsection three says

461
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,200
that these importer correction s are to

462
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,000
be treated as redeterminations made by a

463
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,840
cbsa officer under 59 so once that

464
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,400
happens they both go down the same

465
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,240
stream in terms of further

466
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,799
redeterminations and

467
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,280
appeals um section 59 is the other way

468
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,200
of Declaration of tariff classification

469
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,679
may change and that's simply when a cbsa

470
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,200
officer directly makes that

471
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,360
redetermination

472
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,120
um subsection 592 says that an important

473
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,919
that an importer is entitled to a notice

474
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,760
of any determination under these

475
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,320
Provisions uh and the form of that

476
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,679
notice is a detailed adjustment

477
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:11,559
statement otherwise known as a

478
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:17,000
Das if the determination under 508 or

479
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
redetermination changes the amount of

480
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,919
the duties payable the Importer must pay

481
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,440
the deficiency or is entitled to a

482
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,120
refund as the case may be as indicated

483
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,480
on the Das

484
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,200
um the fritz case also lays this out uh

485
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,760
at paragraph 8 uh for your

486
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,159
reference uh once a Das is issued the

487
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,559
custom act provides a multi-level appeal

488
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,360
scheme set out in sections 59 to

489
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,840
68 under 59 as as I indicated uh the

490
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,120
cvsa May redetermined the Tariff

491
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,039
classification of goods within four

492
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,240
years of the date it was first

493
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,919
determined under

494
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,440
58 under Section 60 an importer can

495
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,720
request a further redetermination by the

496
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,400
president of the

497
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,559
cbsa in respect of anything that's

498
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:14,279
already been redetermined essentially an

499
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,640
appeal under Section 67 an importer May

500
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,159
appeal a section 60 decision to the

501
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,240
CIT and finally section 68 says that a

502
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,840
decision of the CIT may be appealed to

503
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,640
the federal court of appeal on a

504
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,880
question of

505
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,600
law now let me let me stop you there and

506
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,200
and cl ask you to clarify for me what

507
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,120
precisely is a SE section 67 or 60

508
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,880
decision composed of is it simply the

509
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,200
Tariff determination or is it also the

510
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,520
the uh retroactive payment of of of

511
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,039
Duties and and interests that arises out

512
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,279
of that decision as well and how how

513
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,320
that

514
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,159
amount has been arrived at or determined

515
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,679
what exactly is captured in this

516
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,640
decision is it the whole decision or is

517
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,080
it simply the Tariff portion of the

518
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
decision that's

519
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,720
reflected uh um typic typically it's the

520
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,600
Tariff portion but what's the important

521
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,039
thing to remember is that under 67 when

522
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,679
the appeal goes to

523
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,640
CIT the case law of both this court the

524
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,360
court of appeal and the CIT makes it

525
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,840
clear that it is not limited it to that

526
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,760
and that even if some an issue raised by

527
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,080
the Importer is not dealt with on a

528
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,240
section 60 appeal if if the if the

529
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,440
president says I'm not dealing with uh

530
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,840
um anything outside of the Tariff

531
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,320
classification it's that issue is still

532
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,760
to be brought to the

533
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,400
CIT so I will go through the case law

534
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,080
that that states that okay thank

535
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,679
you uh and as as I will come to the

536
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,960
courts have consistently found that this

537
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,000
scheme CS the jurisdiction of the

538
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,440
federal court on the matter subject to

539
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,080
it in the fritz case for

540
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,000
example

541
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,039
um now a self-correction by the Importer

542
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,520
or redetermination by the

543
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,039
cbsa uh can in certain

544
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:19,120
circumstances what be prompted by a a

545
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,159
trade compliance verification carried

546
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,520
out by the cbsa these are random

547
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,120
compliance verifications that the cbsa

548
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,600
conducts from time to time

549
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,279
in order to ensure compliance with the

550
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,159
Customs act these are carried out

551
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:36,039
pursuant to section

552
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,720
4201 uh and and they and and they review

553
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,120
declarations made by importers during a

554
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,679
particular verification

555
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,840
period so that's that's the the act the

556
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,159
relevant portions of the ACT uh as we

557
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,760
see it that pertain to tariff class

558
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,919
classification and the imposition of

559
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:03,039
Duties uh I'll I'll now move on to the

560
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,360
provisions regarding penalties I'll try

561
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,640
to move pretty quickly through this part

562
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,360
um subsection

563
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,200
109.2 um says that every person who

564
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,760
fails to comply with any designated

565
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,279
provision in the ACT is liable to a

566
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,440
penalty of not more than $25,000 as the

567
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,760
minister may

568
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,880
direct the designated Provisions Customs

569
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,360
regulate

570
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,440
include section 32.2 of the Customs act

571
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,200
as a designated provision we've included

572
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,240
those at tab three of our book

573
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,120
reference so since that's 32.2 is

574
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,279
designated if an importer fails to

575
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,640
correct declaration within 90 days of

576
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
having reason to believe its declaration

577
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,760
is incorrect it is a contravention of

578
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,640
the act that attracts a

579
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,039
penalty section uh 109.3 says that an

580
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,480
office May assess and issue a penalty to

581
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
a person liable under

582
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,440
1091 and serve on the person a written

583
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,600
notice of penalty

584
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:11,279
assessment so when that is

585
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,159
issued uh the the ACT sets out a

586
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,320
separate appeal scheme that relates to

587
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,039
the

588
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,960
Penalty under

589
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,480
1291

590
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,000
d a person served with a notice of

591
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,559
penalty assessment may request a

592
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,399
decision of the minister of Public

593
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,480
Safety and preparedness under under

594
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,520
Section

595
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,000
131 1311 C says that where such a

596
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,679
request is made the minister shall

597
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,720
consider the case and decide whether the

598
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
person indeed failed to comply with the

599
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,760
act so that's what that's the decision

600
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,559
the minister is looking

601
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,600
at and

602
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,080
1321b says that if the minister finds

603
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,200
there was no contravention and a penalty

604
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,360
was not

605
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,000
justified the only result provided is

606
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,919
that the minister will cancel the

607
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,799
assessment of penalty and off authorize

608
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,399
the return of the money and interest

609
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:04,159
paid on account of the

610
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:10,080
penalty section 135 provides that a 131

611
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,279
decision of the

612
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,559
minister may be appealed by way of an

613
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,799
action in the federal court with the

614
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,679
minister as a defendant that's what

615
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,559
ostensively we're dealing with here

616
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,159
today and and again specifically what is

617
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,159
the subject of that 135

618
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,159
the right the the 135 is an appeal of

619
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,760
the decision under 131 by the minister

620
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,000
and that

621
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,399
decision is exclusively dealing with

622
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:44,679
whether the the Importer indeed failed

623
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,640
to comply with the ACT such that a

624
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,240
penalty may be imposed and the results

625
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,600
of that as I say is is is limited to

626
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,520
what's in section

627
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,919
1321b so if that appeal to the minister

628
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,279
is successful the only consequence is

629
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,799
canceling the penalty and returning

630
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,120
it

631
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,640
um the federal court so on a 135 appeal

632
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,399
I'll add that it states that the federal

633
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:14,600
courts Act and the rules on an ordinary

634
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,440
action is applicable on an action

635
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,919
brought under Section 135 and that's

636
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,320
according to subsection two of that

637
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,799
provision uh so it's important to see

638
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,880
that the scheme set out in the act um

639
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,320
number one out as we'll see out the

640
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,039
federal Court's Jurisdiction as it

641
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,760
pertains to uh tariff classification and

642
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,440
the duties resulting

643
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,480
um and and sets out a scheme for that

644
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,600
and it sets out a separate scheme for

645
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,399
the

646
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:48,679
penalties let me sorry I may be getting

647
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:51,200
ahead of you and if I am just say so but

648
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,360
so the the one 129 process allows a an

649
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,279
individual to or or Corporation to uh

650
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,720
seek a decision from the minister on the

651
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,159
issue of

652
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,240
compliance and and or the issue of the

653
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,799
nature of the penalty imposed am I

654
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,279
correct in understanding that's the

655
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,440
scope of

656
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,440
129 uh there are there there are two

657
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,000
Roots within that so it it it's

658
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,559
um in terms of the compliance that you

659
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,279
just spoke of it's only as it pertains

660
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,880
to the Penalty so it's not about whether

661
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,559
they got the Tariff classifed ific right

662
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,559
understood so it's an appeal of the

663
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,559
notice penalty assessment essentially

664
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,000
but there are two different Provisions

665
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,679
uh that apply so if it if in terms of

666
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,240
the uh whether or not the Act was

667
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,360
actually contravened by the

668
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,080
Importer is a decision under 131 yes and

669
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,960
there can be a separate decision about

670
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
the amount of the penalty which would be

671
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,240
issued under

672
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,679
133 the 135 uh

673
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,679
um appeal which goes to to the federal

674
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,640
court on an action is limited to whether

675
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,240
or not the 131 decision which is whether

676
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,159
or not there was a

677
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,960
contravention if the Importer wishes to

678
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,240
challenge uh

679
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,880
the

680
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,799
amount in a in in a in a somewhat odd

681
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,240
formulation of this act it it has to

682
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,399
pursue a judicial

683
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,880
review on that issue and I and I will I

684
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,880
will touch on that in a moment uh and

685
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,440
give a reference and factually um just

686
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,240
just to help me out in this particular

687
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,559
Circumstance the

688
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:43,200
contravention uh is there's there's a

689
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
determination that there was a

690
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,799
contravention of the act and a penalty

691
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,679
was

692
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:51,080
imposed and helped me understand exactly

693
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,399
what that penalty there appears to have

694
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,480
been two two items or two tariffs that

695
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,919
were an issue here uh as I understand

696
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,760
the record there was a $500 penalty

697
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,919
imposed with respect to one set of items

698
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,440
and a second $500 penalty imposed with

699
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,960
respect to the wheels issue that are

700
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,880
that's that's form the subject matter of

701
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,880
this particular action am I

702
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,679
correct uh yeah we we can go to that if

703
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,840
you want wish which is at the um I don't

704
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,240
need to go I I go if it's helpful but I

705
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,679
but I really just want to make sure that

706
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,840
I'm factually understanding the nature

707
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,399
of the penalty and what what portion of

708
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:28,519
the penalty

709
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,399
if it is at all in dispute here what

710
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,799
portion of the penalty is is an issue

711
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,559
okay well I guess I would answer that

712
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,000
with two points number one yes the

713
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,440
verification in this case did deal with

714
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,360
two different items that were imported

715
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,360
so one is the is the ruff boore wheels

716
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,919
uh and and that's what we're dealing

717
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,200
with today and that's the subject of

718
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,880
this action the other item is not the

719
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,519
subject of this AC and the penalty

720
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,000
imposed for the rough four wheels was a

721
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,279
$500 penalty am I correct uh I believe

722
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,840
it says $500 the plane ifs indicate a

723
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,279
thousand I

724
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,600
think that's my question okay they

725
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,760
appear to capture the whole of the

726
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,320
penalty for the two items uh my question

727
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,080
is are we engaged with both items here

728
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,080
today or we engaged with only one uh

729
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,880
well we would be engaged only with one

730
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,320
but even as far as that goes that's not

731
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,519
really the the core of what brings us

732
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,679
here on this motion to strike today

733
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,880
understood okay does that answer your

734
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,919
question it does perhaps Mr Baxter will

735
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,000
be able to clarify exactly what's the

736
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,519
issue it I understand it's not not the

737
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,760
core issue here but factually this seems

738
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,000
to all work together with a a series of

739
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
decisions that have been undertaken and

740
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,679
challenged through different routs and

741
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,480
that seems to be part of the uh the

742
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,960
underline basis for the for the uh for

743
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,880
the claims that are being advanced in

744
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,240

understand what's what the basis of

746
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,679
those those PLS are right the the the

747
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,039
the the challenge to the notice of

748
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,799
penalty assessment and therefore the

749
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,880
subsequent ministerial decision is

750
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
related to the Penalty imposed on the

751
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,360

um I'll now briefly go through uh

755
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,279
briefly as I can uh through the central

756
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,360
facts of this case as as as the

757
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,200
defendant sees it as set out in the

758
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,720
fresh as amended statement of claim and

759
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,519
the documents at

760
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:24,880
references uh as noted the plff is a

761
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
manufacturer and supplier of Railway

762
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,799
Wheels

763
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,200
uh and Wheel

764
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,960
sets um it Imports rough boore Wheels

765
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,840
into Canada from

766
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,559
2005 it declared the rough boore Wheels

767
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,120
it imported under a tariff item

768
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,240
8671

769
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,399
1921 I'll just refer to it as the one

770
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:49,120
ending in point 21 uh which is

771
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,240
dutyfree so items under that

772
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,399
classification don't incur any

773
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,039
Duty in July of 2017 this cbsa commenced

774
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,600
a trade compliance verification audit

775
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,360
under Section

776
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,919
4201 for goods imported by the plaintiff

777
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,760
including the rough Bo Wheels as noted

778
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
they also looked at another

779
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,559
item with respect to the wheels it

780
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,760
looked at five sample importations that

781
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,559
occurred in

782
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:23,039
2015 the verification process

783
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,159
resulted in the cbsa final verification

784
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,519
report which was issued in July

785
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:32,679
2018 and that is at a tab

786
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,840
3A of the defendants book of

787
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,919
authorities um I can take you there

788
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,960
unless you're familiar enough with the

789
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,799
facts that you that that wouldn't be

790
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,519
helpful um but I'll just briefly go

791
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:53,420
through that as as it pertains to

792
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,509
[Music]

793
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:09,839
uh do you you have okay I do

794
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,119
have good um in the first

795
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,200
paragraph on the first page it indicates

796
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,000
that the verification period is from

797
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,560
July 1st 2015 to December 31st

798
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,720
2015 so that means that the sample trans

799
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,200
transactions it's going to look at come

800
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,839
from that period that the cbsa will

801
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,040
looked

802
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,159
at the fourth

803
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,359
paragraph indicates that some of the

804
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:39,000
goods in this verification were found to

805
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,359
be classified

806
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:42,520
incorrectly and that dases would be

807
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,879
issued to correct the tarff

808
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:46,280
classification of the specific sample

809
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,480
importations that were looked

810
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,919
at at the paragraph of the bottom of the

811
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:56,679
page it says under Section 32.2 of the

812
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,320
Customs Act importers have an obligation

813
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,160
to make a correction to a declaration of

814
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,040
tariff classification within 90 days

815
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,960
after the Importer has reason to believe

816
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,400
the original declaration is

817
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,920
incorrect um the findings specifically

818
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,400
with respect to the rough boore wheels

819
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,440
are on page three of the verification

820
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,359
report which I'm not sure if you're

821
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,839
looking electronically it's page 33 of

822
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,440
the

823
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,920
PDF I have it yes

824
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,920
uh the cbsa so starting starting with

825
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,320
the heading at the in the middle of the

826
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,359
page the cbsa finds the verified samples

827
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,400
were properly classified you see

828
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,720
classification declared and

829
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,440
classification

830
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,000
determined cbsa finds they were properly

831
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,440
classified under a tariff item ending in

832
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,560
29 which carries a 99.5%

833
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,160
duty rather than the item ending in a 21

834
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,160
as declared by the pl of

835
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,040
which incurs no

836
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,200
duties on the following

837
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,079
page uh it indicates the finding that

838
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,520
the plane have had specific

839
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,079
information so in the middle of the

840
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,400
page after the two uh links it says that

841
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,720
uh the plaintiff had a specific

842
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,079
information available to it so a reason

843
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,920
to believe regarding the Tariff

844
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,760
classification of the

845
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,520
goods and that was that the uh that the

846
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,400
Tariff was clear

847
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,839
essentially at the bottom of the page

848
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,839
the plaintive is required to correct

849
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:49,280
within 90 days of the date of the

850
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,880
report all of other transactions of the

851
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,119
same Goods that were verified back to a

852
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,640
maximum of four years

853
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,319
go to the following

854
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,079
page near the bottom of the page where

855
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,319
it says samples 4 five6

856
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,800
Etc uh this section deals with the

857
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,960
administrative monetary

858
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,720
penalty uh and and the samples 4 five6 6

859
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,520
Etc deals with the rough Bo

860
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,920
Wheels uh it states that by failing

861
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,480
failing to earlier correct its tariff

862
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,560
classification within 90 days of having

863
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,599
a reason to believe the plaint of

864
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,440
contravene section 32.2 of the Customs

865
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,880
act and that an MPA would be

866
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,200
assessed so that's the verification

867
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,200
report

868
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,079
um in August of

869
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,160
2018 the cbsa issued

870
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,079
redeterminations as it indicated it

871
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,200
would of the Tariff classification for

872
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,079
the five samples that it looked at in

873
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,000
the verification process so those are

874
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,839
redeterminations issued under Section

875
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,720
591 and these redetermination imposed

876
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,640
redeterminations impose duties on those

877
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,200
importations to reflect the N9 .5% Duty

878
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,040
rate under the proper clar

879
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,079
classification uh and for your reference

880
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,640
those are located at tab 3C the

881
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,640
defendants

882
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,079
record they did not involve

883
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,640
self-corrections they were just straight

884
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,280
redeterminations under

885
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,680
9 uh the plane have followed the appeal

886
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,160
scheme in the Customs act with respect

887
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,160
to those dases and brought an appeal on

888
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,960
the on on these five redetermined

889
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,000
samples to the president of the

890
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,599
cbsa under Section

891
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:05,280
60 it appealed the

892
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,319
section and and it was denied that

893
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:09,680
appeal and it appealed the section 60

894
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,440
decision further to the

895
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,520
CIT the C decision is at uh

896
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,079
tab

897
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,560
3D the CIT dismissed the appeal in March

898
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,520
of 2020 and confirmed the cbsa

899
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,359
determination that the rough Bo wheels

900
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,839
are properly classified with a duty of

901
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,440
99.5% and that the plainf had improperly

902
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,319
classified them under a duty-free

903
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:41,440
item the plff did not seek review of the

904
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,760
cit's

905
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,520
decision accordingly there's no dispute

906
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,319
that the plain if had been incorrectly

907
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,960
declaring the goods for years since 2005

908
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,119
under the wrong tariff

909
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,319
classification benefiting from the

910
00:39:56,319 --> 00:39:57,920
duty-free

911
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,359
classification the only issue the plan

912
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,680
of disputes is which years it had to

913
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,359
self-correct for under Section

914
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,000
32.2 and pay duties

915
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,440
on now at the same time it was pursuing

916
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,440
those challenges of the five samples the

917
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,960
plan have also filed corrections as

918
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,079
instructed covering the rest of its

919
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:23,720
importations of the wheels for the years

920
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,880
2015 to

921

that's

927
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,440
correct um

928
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,560
in May of that year of 2019 the cbsa

929
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,599
issued dases for those importations

930
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:07,119
pursuant to the plaintiff's Corrections

931
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,319
and imposed the related duties

932
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,119
owing so those it through that process

933
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,680
the corrections were were deemed to be

934
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,240
redeterminations under 591a of the

935
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,960
Customs act and those dases are at tab

936
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,960
3F

937
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,960
the plf again pursued the statutory

938
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,359
appeal route with respect to those

939
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,480
importations appealing the Das as

940
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,000
related to the corrections under Section

941
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,880
60 of the Customs act and on July 30th

942
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,599
2020 the president of the cbsa issued

943
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,000
his decision

944
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,319
upholding the determination under 59 in

945
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:53,640
the form of a Das and that is the July

946
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,800
2020

947
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,720
Das which the plaintiff seeks to

948
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,599
overturn and that is found at tab

949
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,000
3G it is that July 2020 dask that

950
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,040
ultimately requires the plaintiff to pay

951
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,119
the retroactive duties and interest the

952
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,560
plaintiff

953
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,760
disputes the pl of commenced a judicial

954
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,760
review application and a CIT appeal both

955
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,319
seeking to overturn July 2020 Das both

956
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,119
proceedings were put in AB bance on

957
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:30,720
consent pending the result of the pus

958
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,280
action under Section 135 of the Customs

959
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,240
act which relates to the

960
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,800
Penalty I would just say as a side note

961
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,480
that when the defendant agreed to put

962
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,599
those those proceedings in advance it

963
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,559
was not we were not aware that the plan

964
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:48,000
would be seeking relief beyond the

965
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,559
limits of section

966
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,359
135 uh on this

967
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,160
action the judicial review notice of

968
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,760
application is at tab 3H for your

969
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:07,440
reference and the CIT appeal is at tab

970
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,720
3i the plan of states that it commenced

971
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,599
this multitude of proceedings based on

972
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,720
various pieces of advice it received

973
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,800
from the

974
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,040
cbsa and based on case law that I

975
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,920
provided indicating that the federal

976
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,280
court does not have jurisdiction over

977
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,520
these matters on a judicial

978
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,839
review if we go to tab

979
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,640
3i and it's page uh 139 of the PDF

980
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,839
that's of

981
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,440
assistance it's the second last page of

982
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,520
the notice of appeal to to the

983
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,480
CIT yes and it's the second last

984
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,359
paragraph we see that the plane of CIT

985
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:52,880
appeal raises front and center the issue

986
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,880
of the reassessment period

987
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,440
it argues that the July 2020 Das should

988
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,839
be reversed and that it should not have

989
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,000
to pay duties on itself Corrections for

990
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,800
the period that it did as it did not

991
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,520
have reason to

992
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,599
believe uh shifting now to the process

993
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,960
that got us here on the section 135

994
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,960
action

995
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,800
go ahead okay uh the cbsa issued a

996
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,319
notice of penalty assessment requiring

997
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:43,599
the plff to pay an administrative

998
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,599
monetary penalty for Contra reading the

999
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,599
Customs act on October 3rd

1000
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,920
2019 and for your reference that's at 3K

1001
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,359
the plan have contested the notice it

1002
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:05,480
argued it had not had prior reason to

1003
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,200
believe that its tariff classifications

1004
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,160
were Incorrect and asked for a

1005
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,079
ministerial review of the assessment

1006
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:14,720
under section 129 of the

1007
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,119
ACT a ministerial decision upholding the

1008
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,839
finding that the plff had contravened

1009
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,599
the act was issued in September of 2020

1010
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:26,800
and is contained at tab 3L

1011
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,400
of note the ministerial decision did not

1012
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,040
deal with the July 2020 Das or duties

1013
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,280
owed by the plaintive which makes sense

1014
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,640
because that was that is not what is

1015
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,079
dealt with on that appeal

1016
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:43,480
route the plan if continued to pursue

1017
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,000
the appeal scheme for challenging

1018
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,760
penalties under the Customs act and

1019
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,280
issued a statement of claim under

1020
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,359
Section

1021
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,520
135 issued in October of

1022
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,079
2020 however instead of asking that the

1023
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:56,559
ministerial decision upholding the

1024
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:59,359
penalty be overturned the plff asked

1025
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,400
that the July 2020 Das be quashed that

1026
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,079
duties and interests pursuant to that

1027
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,920
Das be reimbursed and that press

1028
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,599
professional fees incurred be

1029
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,440
reimbursed after the defendant indicated

1030
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,920
an intention to file a motion to strike

1031
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,000
the plff filed a fresh as amended

1032
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,520
statement of claim to include pleadings

1033
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,280
of

1034
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,839
negligence and breach of public law

1035
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:28,160
duties as discussed in parody honey and

1036
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,480
to add a claim for General

1037
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,839
damages nowhere in its statement of

1038
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,440
claim or its fresh amended statement of

1039
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
claim does the plantiff explicitly

1040
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,920
request an over an order overturning the

1041
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,319
September 2020 ministerial decision that

1042
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,280
upheld the penalty assess assessment

1043
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,319
which is the main focus of a 135

1044
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:52,760
action so those cover the and this may

1045
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,119
be a semantics issue but so I'm

1046
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,400
clear that that ministerial decision

1047
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,359
does two things it finds one a

1048
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,960
contravention and

1049
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,000
two uh upholds the penalty assessment uh

1050
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,880
it upholds is that fair articul what's

1051
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,680
happening there yes it upholds the fact

1052
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,920
that a penalty was imposed it doesn't

1053
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,559
deal with the amount of the penalty

1054
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:19,280
under Section 131 understood

1055
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,000
okay so those cover the central facts

1056
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,800
and legislation applicable to this case

1057
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,119
in The defendant's View

1058
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,880
as I said we will now make submissions

1059
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,839
seeking to strike the portions of the

1060
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:33,119
claim or I will now make submissions

1061
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,920
seeking to strike portions of the

1062
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,480
claim uh number

1063
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,520
one uh requesting an order quashing as

1064
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,119
unreasonable the July 2020 Das and

1065
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,640
number two damages for Customs act

1066
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,400
duties and interest paid retro act my

1067
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,599
colleague will then focus on the

1068
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,160
remainder of our

1069
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,440
submissions uh we will both address some

1070
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,880
of the plaintiff's arguments in their

1071
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,760
factum as we move along

1072
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,559
um first in address

1073
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:06,599
address sorry to rise uh justice gleon

1074
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:10,000
if I might just a word yes Mr back I'm

1075
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,640
sorry Mr nosach and um I just wanted

1076
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,599
perhaps we can shorten things uh Ronco

1077
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,240
has proposed an amendment that is not

1078
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,200
seeking to quash the dash Ronco

1079
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,280
acknowledges the problems U called out

1080
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,319
by my friend in the case Fritz and

1081
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,200
others and paragraph 1A is no longer

1082
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,359
sought as relief in this case so to the

1083
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:35,119
extent my friend was going to take um

1084
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,520
take time to uh to uh dispute uh the

1085
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,119
relief sought in paragraph 1A I can

1086
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,079
perhaps shorten proceedings today by

1087
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,920
assuring the court that in any event if

1088
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,240
if unless this this action is completely

1089
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,599
uh struck in the water struck dead in

1090
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:56,079
the water paragraph 1A will not be um

1091
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,480
will not be s and quashing the Das per

1092
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,000
se is is no longer a relief s and I hope

1093
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,240
perhaps that's of assistance to Mr nosb

1094
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,880
and into the court and I'm sorry to

1095
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,720
interrupt Mr nosb and I just thought it

1096
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,599
might

1097
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:13,839
assist thank you Mr Baxter Mr

1098
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,599
nosp um our our submission is that

1099
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:22,240
removing that single paragraph from the

1100
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,599
claim

1101
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,359
um is merely cosmetic

1102
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:30,960
removing that signpost does not change

1103
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,640
the essential character of the claim

1104
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,920
which is a matter that is to go to the

1105
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,160
CIT the claim seeks to nullify the

1106
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,799
Das which can only only be properly

1107
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:44,119
challenged through the Customs act

1108
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:46,799
scheme and so I do think it is important

1109
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:50,040
to go through the to go through the

1110
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,160
law as it relates to jurisdiction on

1111
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,240
these matters uh and so uh

1112
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,000
if it pleases you justice gleon I I will

1113
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,680
proceed to do so go ahead

1114
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,280
okay first in addressing the claim it

1115
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,640
should be understood that the section

1116
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,040
135 of the Customs act does not justify

1117
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,079
or authorize what the plaintiff is

1118
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,960
seeking uh in this

1119
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,960
action section 135 actions restricted to

1120
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,359
an appeal of The Minister's decision

1121
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:23,559
under

1122
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:26,520
131 and the ACT clearly sets out that

1123
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,280
the only consequences flowing from the

1124
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,640
decision relate to the Penalty

1125
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,799
assessment this is seen uh in the fact

1126
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:36,119
that as we briefly discussed an importer

1127
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:38,240
must separately bring an application for

1128
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,240
judicial review to challenge a decision

1129
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,720
on the penalty

1130
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,160
amount rather than including it in a 135

1131
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,799
action we see this discussed for example

1132
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:51,359
in the starway case which just for your

1133
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,880
referen is at tab 49 in paragraph 23

1134
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,359
where the court said says the action is

1135
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:01,000
limited to whether or not there was an

1136
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,440
infraction to appeal the decision with

1137
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,400
respect to the amount of a penalty Mr

1138
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,440
starway was required to apply for

1139
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,200
judicial review a completely distinct

1140
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,599
procedure um the plaintiff's Fresh's

1141
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:16,440
amended statement of claim goes well

1142
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,040
beyond these limits of a section 135

1143
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,720
appeal so I'll refer the court now to

1144
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,960
the hos young versus Canada decision

1145
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,520
which uh at the trial level you presided

1146
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,599
over Justice gleon um in the federal

1147
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,640
court of appeal decision the court of

1148
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,839
appeal confirmed that a section 135

1149
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:40,440
appeal per se concerns no genuine issue

1150
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,400
other than whether there was indeed a

1151
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,480
contravention of the Customs

1152
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,839
act at paragraph 57 it states and this

1153
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,760
is for reference at tab

1154
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,040
25 yes having correctly concluded that

1155
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,119
there was a contravention to sections 12

1156
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,079
of the C act the federal court had the

1157
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,000
power pursuant to Rule 25 to dismiss all

1158
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,240
the allegations related to the appeal

1159
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,480
pursuant to section 135 of the Customs

1160
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,760
act as involves no other genuine

1161
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,720
issue however the federal court of

1162
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,319
appeal found that the rules of severance

1163
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:17,240
and Joiner also apply to a section 135

1164
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,839
action and on that basis it declined to

1165
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:23,400
dismiss other causes of action brought

1166
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,960
by the plaintiff such as allegations of

1167
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,359
threats of violence solely on the basis

1168
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:30,880
that they fell outside of

1169
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,359
135 so the court said we can't get rid

1170
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,040
of those just because they're outside of

1171
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,480
135 given the rules of

1172
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,960
Joiner notably the defendant in that

1173
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,920
case had not challenged the individual

1174
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,760
claims on any basis other than they fell

1175
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,520
outside the limits of a section 135

1176
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,119
action in this case we

1177
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,640
do not only do we submit that the plain

1178
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,480
if's claim Falls outside the scope of a

1179
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,480
135 Act

1180
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,000
and cannot be justified by that section

1181
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,520
but also that they disclose no

1182
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,319
reasonable cause of action in their own

1183
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:05,040
right and are outside of this Court's

1184
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,720
Jurisdiction and should therefore be

1185
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,040
struck now I'm glad so the first the

1186
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,040
first issue of course is is whether is

1187
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,880
the first item requested in the claim

1188
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,760
which is uh that the July 2020

1189
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,440
D be struck be quashed I should say be

1190
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,319
quashed as unreasonable and my friend

1191
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:34,880
has indicated that there no longer

1192
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,599
pursuing that um so I won't belabor the

1193
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,079
point but suffice it to say that

1194
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:44,880
subsection 183 of the federal courts act

1195
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,559
provides that uh extraordinary remedies

1196
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:49,880
such as cerai may be attained by the

1197
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,480
federal court from the federal court

1198
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,280
only by way of judicial

1199
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,079
review uh so the the pl of can't get

1200
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,200
there on an action that's well

1201
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,520
established but what is still

1202
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,960
significant and

1203
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,520
important uh to understand is that here

1204
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,799
we are dealing with a d redetermining

1205
00:54:08,799 --> 00:54:10,640
tariff classification and imposing

1206
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,440
duties under the Customs act and in

1207
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,280
these circumstances Parliament has set

1208
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,559
up a scheme that must be followed and

1209
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:19,119
which ousts the federal Court's

1210
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,920
Jurisdiction even on judicial

1211
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,040
review that is the appeal scheme that we

1212
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,520
went through through uh contained in

1213
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,920
sections 59 to 68 of the Customs

1214
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,559
act this court and the federal court of

1215
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,200
appeal have consistently found with this

1216
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
process Parliament has outed the

1217
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,520
jurisdiction of the federal court to

1218
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,319
quash a Das for any

1219
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:46,480
reason the federal court of appeal has

1220
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,640
held that the CIT has the authority on

1221
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,160
an appeal under Section 67 of the

1222
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,440
Customs act to determine not only the

1223
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,520
correctness of a decision on the merits

1224
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,280
for example whether the cvsa arrived at

1225
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,000
the correct tariff

1226
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,599
classification but also on the das's

1227
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,680
validity uh and I will take you to the

1228
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,880
fritz decision of the federal court of

1229
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:17,040
appeal which is at volume one tab

1230
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,799
20 uh uh in this case the court of

1231
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:29,480
appeal determined it did not have

1232
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,880
jurisdiction to hear a Jr on the

1233
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,280
validity of a Das because it fell within

1234
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,400
the Customs act appeal

1235
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,400
scheme the case concerns uh value for

1236
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,240
Duty declarations rather than tariff

1237
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,440
classifications but as I noted the same

1238
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,599
appeal scheme applies in the same way to

1239
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:50,440
both briefly the cbsa investigator was

1240
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,640
granted a search warrant seized

1241
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,400
documents of the

1242
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,720
applicant and these form the base for

1243
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,960
criminal

1244
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,720
charges a court later set aside the

1245
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,680
search warrant as violating the charter

1246
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,319
and the documents were deemed

1247
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,640
inadmissible outside those criminal

1248
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,880
proceedings the cbsa issued a Das under

1249
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,799
Section 59 based on the information

1250
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,039
obtained as a result of the

1251
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,240
unconstitutional search

1252
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,079
warrant the applicant asked the cbsa to

1253
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:22,920
cancel the Das because they were based

1254
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,079
on unlawfully obtained

1255
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:28,039
evidence when the cbsa refused to resend

1256
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:30,839
the dases the applicant brought a Jr to

1257
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:31,839
set

1258
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,200
aside those decisions because they were

1259
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,240
issued on the basis of information

1260
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,839
obtained in breach of the charter the

1261
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:41,119
federal court granted the application

1262
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,359
but the federal court of appeal allowed

1263
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:46,240
Canada's Appeal on the basis that by

1264
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,440
virtue of customs of the Customs act

1265
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,039
scheme Parliament has has ousted

1266
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:52,920
jurisdiction of the federal court to

1267
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,599
quash Adas paragraphs 31 to 36 are the

1268
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,440
most

1269
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,599
helpful um 31 says the jurisdiction of

1270
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:04,000
the federal court in relation to

1271
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,119
detailed adjustment

1272
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:08,359
statements was considered more recently

1273
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:11,640
in Abbot in that case Justice Lemieux

1274
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,680
concluded that by virtue of the scheme

1275
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,400
of the Customs act that includes the

1276
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,520
privative Clauses quoted above

1277
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,200
Parliament has ousted the jurisdiction

1278
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,000
of the federal court to quash a detailed

1279
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,359
adjustment statement in the alternative

1280
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,039
he would have declined jurisdiction on

1281
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:27,000
the basis of the existing

1282
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,799
an adequate statutory

1283
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:34,640
remedy par down in paragraph 33 Court

1284
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,839
says I agree with Justice

1285
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:40,039
Lemieux that subsection 596 which is the

1286
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,559
privative Clause of the Customs act

1287
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,240
deprives the federal court of the

1288
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,640
jurisdiction to set aside a detailed

1289
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,440
adjustment statement for any

1290
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:54,720
reason and then in 34 he explains I

1291
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,720
appreciate that in the federal court

1292
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,160
application the detailed adjustment

1293
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,760
statements were not being challenged on

1294
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,640
the merits but rather on the basis that

1295
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,839
the agency should not have issued them

1296
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:07,119
using information subsequently found to

1297
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,319
have been obtained in breach of Section

1298
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,960
8 of the

1299
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:15,160
chart indeed the issue as framed by the

1300
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,119
parties and as adopted by Justice Hughes

1301
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,960
was a challenge to the decision of the

1302
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,640
agency to refus to cancel the detailed

1303
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,319
adjustment statements when asked to do

1304
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,559
so however in my view the parties and

1305
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,240
Justice hes mischaracterize the question

1306
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,520
to accept their characterization would

1307
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,799
be to accept a semantic

1308
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:36,640
exercise any challenge to a detailed

1309
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,760
adjustment statement could be

1310
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,319
characterized as a challenge to the

1311
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:41,880
decision of the agency not to cancel it

1312
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,920
as long as the agency refuses to cancel

1313
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,520
it when asked and in paragraph 36 it the

1314
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,599
court references that it's the CIT that

1315
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:53,000
is the tribunal that has the mandate to

1316
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,440
determine the validity and correctness

1317
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,720
of the detail adjustment

1318
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,160
statements uh in

1319
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,920
Jockey this course this this court

1320
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,599
followed Fritz in

1321
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:08,920
dismissing an application that involved

1322
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,240
the same issues the plaintiff raises in

1323
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,640
its challenge to the July 2020 Das in

1324
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,079
this

1325
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:18,079
case the federal court decision is at

1326
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:23,079
Volume 2 tab 30 of the defendant's book

1327
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:25,760
and the subsequent CIT appeal decision

1328
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,680
is at tab

1329
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,480
31 and the CIT decision gives a more

1330
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,200
thorough rundown of the facts in

1331
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,160
procedural history I'll just briefly

1332
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,559
outline them because they are very

1333
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:40,200
similar to what we're dealing with

1334
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,760
here in 2005 the cbsa began a

1335
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,400
verification audit and issued its report

1336
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,359
in 2008 in that case the report

1337
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,359
concluded the applicants methods for

1338
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,400
calculating value for Duty were

1339
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,599
Incorrect and it stipulated the correct

1340
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:56,559
method

1341
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,079
it also found that the applicant had

1342
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,200
reason to believe its declarations were

1343
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,400
incorrect since

1344
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,960
2005 and it required the applicant to

1345
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,280
self-correct its declarations for All

1346
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,880
Imports going back four years in that

1347
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,760
case 2005 to 2008 pursuant to section

1348
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,000
32.2 of the

1349
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,319
act the applicant asked the cbsa to

1350
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,079
resend its requirement that it go back

1351
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,760
four years among other things it argued

1352
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,720
that it didn't have reason to believe at

1353
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,480
any earlier date until it received the

1354
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,119
2008 report and that it should at most

1355
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:34,799
only be required to self correct and pay

1356
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,880
duties on a go forward basis similar to

1357
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,720
the plaintiffs

1358
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,000
here cbsa refused and issued dases

1359
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,400
redetermining the

1360
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,880
goods the applicant filed a judicial

1361
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,359
review seeking to quash the

1362
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:52,599
decision the federal court dismissed

1363
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:54,359
that application on the basis that it

1364
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,559
did not have jurisdiction to determine

1365
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,920
the issue relied on previous jurist

1366
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,599
prudence and finding and found that the

1367
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,079
case fall fell in line with

1368
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,559
Fritz the issu the issues the applicant

1369
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,359
raised in that case squarely concerned

1370
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:10,760
whether the applicant had reason to

1371
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,520
believe its declarations were incorrect

1372
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,720
at the time of import and whether it

1373
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,480
would need to correct its declarations

1374
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,280
and pay duties going back four

1375
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,640
years at paragraph 30 of the Jockey

1376
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,559
decision in the federal court the court

1377
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,359
found that this is a matter for the

1378
01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:32,039
Customs act appeal scheme quote I am of

1379
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:33,960
the view this is a matter for the

1380
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,640
president of the cbsa and if unresolved

1381
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,400
for appeal to the CIT the specialized

1382
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,039
tribunal designed by Parliament to

1383
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:44,599
resolve such issues and at paragraph 31

1384
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:47,039
the court concludes the federal court

1385
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:49,079
does not have jurisdiction to hear this

1386
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,440
matter in the alternative I would follow

1387
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,400
Justice McTavish in outer space Sports

1388
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,119
decline to entertain the application for

1389
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:57,760
judicial review because the review

1390
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,640
process in the act constitutes an

1391
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,520
adequate alternate

1392
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,119
remedy the federal court followed Fritz

1393
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:06,240
and jockey in the recent case of

1394
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,160
Sketchers which we uh filed with the

1395
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,480
court subsequent to our

1396
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,480
factum

1397
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,960
um again it's very similar after

1398
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,920
conducting a verification the cbsa

1399
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,599
required Sketchers to perform

1400
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:23,400
self-corrections of declarations and pay

1401
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,039
duties going back four years from the

1402
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:28,160
date of the report the date of the

1403
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,799
report in the Sketcher case was deemed

1404
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:32,599
to be the date the applicant first had

1405
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:34,760
reason to believe this declarations were

1406
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,440
incorrect so in that case it differed in

1407
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,480
that there was no earlier reason to

1408
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,359
believe found it was only with the

1409
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,039
issuance of the

1410
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,359
report the applicant had argued and even

1411
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:50,839
with that I might add even with that no

1412
01:02:50,839 --> 01:02:54,839
earlier reason to believe it was held

1413
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:57,520
that the Importer in that case had to

1414
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,520
pay for the previous self-correct and

1415
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,920
pay any duties for the previous four

1416
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,279
years uh the applicant had argued that

1417
01:03:05,279 --> 01:03:07,160
it should only have to make Corrections

1418
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,920
on a go forward basis into the

1419
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,359
future and requested the cbsa cbsa grant

1420
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,039
that request which the cbsa refused so

1421
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:17,760
Sketchers brought a judicial review of

1422
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,799
that

1423
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,039
refusal Sketchers included

1424
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:24,680
arguments that the cbsa was deviating

1425
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,920
from its policies

1426
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,960
and from how it treated other

1427
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,920
importers in requiring it to

1428
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,920
self-correct for the previous four years

1429
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,880
very

1430
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,400
similar the cbsa brought a motion to

1431
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,279
strike that application which the court

1432
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:45,279
granted and the court found at paragraph

1433
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:48,720
23 I I'll read that portion there is no

1434
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,680
basis however to conclude that the

1435
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,079
federal court has jurisdiction to weigh

1436
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:57,119
in as Justice Stratus in AP Morgan notes

1437
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,319
a failure to follow policies is not by

1438
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,160
itself an abuse of discretion policies

1439
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,279
do not have the force of Law and

1440
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:06,880
administrative decision makers can

1441
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,680
depart from them the matters disclosed

1442
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,720
by Sketchers concern the methodology for

1443
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,359
determining value for Duty and Sketcher

1444
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,680
obligations flowing there from under the

1445
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,760
Customs

1446
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,359
act Sketchers can put its arguments

1447
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,440
concerning cbsa decisions policies and

1448
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,760
discretion as the Importer in Fritz

1449
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,440
marketing could Advance Charter

1450
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,400
arguments to the president of the cbsa

1451
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,520
the CIT and the federal court of

1452
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,960
appeal the court concluded by stating

1453
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,480
that as in Jockey the application should

1454
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,720
be dismissed on the grounds that the

1455
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,359
federal court did not have

1456
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,319
jurisdiction finally on this point I

1457
01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:46,839
would just mention the federal court of

1458
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:50,240
appeals decision in the CB Powell case

1459
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,880
which for reference is at Tab four of

1460
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,480
our book of

1461
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,400
words this case stands for the fact that

1462
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,760
an importer must complete the appeal

1463
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,279
scheme in the Customs act before seeking

1464
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:04,359
recourse to the courts and perhaps this

1465
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:05,960
relates to a point we were discussing

1466
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,319
earlier this means an importer should

1467
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:12,079
pursue an appeal to the CIT on an issue

1468
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,880
even if the cbsa refused to deal with it

1469
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,880
on a section 60

1470
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,520
appeal in the CB Powell

1471
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,720
case the cbsa president refused to

1472
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,559
address an issue on a section 60

1473
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:30,160
redetermination that did not explicitly

1474
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,880
form part of the officer's section 59

1475
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,400
redetermination under appeal but that

1476
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,039
the Importer had raised at the 59

1477
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,839
stage the Importer brought a judicial

1478
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:44,480
review seeking a declaration that the

1479
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,960
cbsa negative jurisdiction decision

1480
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,240
could lead to an appeal to the

1481
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,200
CIT Justice Stratus States under the ACT

1482
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,039
Parliament has established administ so

1483
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,960
and the and the court granted that the

1484
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,640
court granted a declaration that that

1485
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,760
the Importer could appeal that to the

1486
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,599
CIT uh and the federal court of appeal

1487
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:08,640
differed slightly saying that under the

1488
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,960
ACT Parliament has established an

1489
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,200
administrative process of adjudications

1490
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,319
and appeals in this area he references

1491
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:17,079
the scheme in the Customs

1492
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:20,240
act he goes on to say the courts are no

1493
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,520
part of this allowing the courts to

1494
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,240
become involved in this administrative

1495
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,079
process before it is completed

1496
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,279
would inject an alien element into

1497
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:30,279
parliament's

1498
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:32,880
design the federal court of appeal found

1499
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,200
that the Importer should have pursued an

1500
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,000
appeal to the

1501
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,640
CIT on the issue whether certain the CIT

1502
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,440
would find it had jurisdiction or not it

1503
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,640
has to the Importer has to go through

1504
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,799
the

1505
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,880
scheme so on the other side of things

1506
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,319
from the cit's point of view the CIT has

1507
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,640
taken up this view of its Authority that

1508
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,079
allows it to examine and Rule upon the

1509
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:06,160
validity of AAS as a whole and not just

1510
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,240
its

1511
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,760
correctness it is not restricted to

1512
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,680
looking only at a strict basis for a

1513
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,559
section 60 decision on its merits such

1514
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:17,559
as the correct tariff classification

1515
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:20,000
origin or value for

1516
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,400
Duty uh we referenced a number of

1517
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,559
examples in uh our factum where the CIT

1518
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:30,799
does this uh including uh where um the

1519
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,799
identification identity of the Importer

1520
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,559
is an issue or where the verification

1521
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,160
audit process was an issue I'll just

1522
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,760
take you to two the groden case and the

1523
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,240
jockey CIT

1524
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,039
case um in groden I I don't think we

1525
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:47,599
have to go there but I I I'll just

1526
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:51,039
outline the decision um in

1527
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:54,279
groden um the case dealt with whether

1528
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,880
the CIT

1529
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,559
could deal with the issue of whether or

1530
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,079
not a Das was invalid as being time

1531
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:03,599
barred for being issued more than four

1532
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,480
years after the relevant importations

1533
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,880
contrary to the

1534
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,480
act on the section 60 appeal the

1535
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,319
president of the cvsa simply upheld the

1536
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,240
findings of the Das and did not deal

1537
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,199
with the time bar

1538
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:20,080
issue the CIT held that it the CIT held

1539
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,400
that it did have jurisdiction to

1540
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,640
determine the issue even if not dealt

1541
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,040
with in the section 6

1542
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,759
decision at paragraph 29 of that case

1543
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,679
the tribunal notes it is clear that

1544
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,480
Parliament intended to confer on the

1545
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,839
tribunal broad appellant jurisdiction in

1546
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:39,199
the tribunal's view its Authority Under

1547
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,080
the ACT is not limited merely to the

1548
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,279
narrow substantive question of the

1549
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,080
correct tariff classification origin or

1550
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,440
value for duty of imported

1551
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,560
goods goes on to say at 33 the tribunal

1552
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,799
has the authority under Section 67 to

1553
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,600
determine not only the correctness of a

1554
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,199
decision made under Section 60 but also

1555
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:03,880
its validity and it cites the britz case

1556
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,560
for

1557
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,719
that and at paragraph 36 the tribunal

1558
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,839
says an appellant must first ask the

1559
01:09:10,839 --> 01:09:13,719
cbsa pursuant to section 60 to

1560
01:09:13,719 --> 01:09:15,960
reconsider the matter and the effect of

1561
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,239
section 67 is to then escalate the

1562
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:20,880
matter to the

1563
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,960
tribunal uh clearly the case law opposes

1564
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,920
the plain assertion in its factum that

1565
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,759
the CIT is limited to considering the

1566
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:31,679
correct

1567
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,120
origin tariff classification or value

1568
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,880
for duty of the

1569
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,040
goods and indicates that that argument

1570
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:43,920
is without Merit when the jockey

1571
01:09:45,799 --> 01:09:48,640
case was uh was was struck by the

1572
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,560
federal court and went back to the

1573
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,640
CIT uh the CIT did not decline to graph

1574
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,280
with the issues at hand in this case as

1575
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,080
the plain of suggesting their fact

1576
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,360
rather it dealt with them at length over

1577
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,320
the course of 38

1578
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,400
paragraphs just for your reference again

1579
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,480
that decision is at tab 31 of the

1580
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,719
defendant's

1581
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:16,520
book the Importer there argued that it

1582
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,920
should not have been required to

1583
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,320
self-correct its declarations and pay

1584
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,880
duties going back four years because it

1585
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,000
did not have earlier reason to believe

1586
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,600
as found by the

1587
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,360
cbsa essentially that the resulting gas

1588
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,199
was invalid as a

1589
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,239
result in its decision the CIT set out

1590
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,120
the party's arguments and positions in

1591
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,520
full by paragraphs 248 to

1592
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,880
260 the CIT found that jockey's

1593
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,920
obligation to self-correct its

1594
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,800
declarations from 2005 to 2008 and pay

1595
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,560
retroactive duties was not in fact

1596
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,760
dependent on jockey having reason to

1597
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,560
believe

1598
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:59,600
in 2005 that its declarations were

1599
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,719
incorrect the CI therefore found that it

1600
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,880
it didn't have to determine specifically

1601
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,159
when jockey first had reason to believe

1602
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:09,480
this declarations were incorrect to

1603
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,960
resolve the appeal and the validity of

1604
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,040
the

1605
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,840
Das it does find that the requirement

1606
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,239
for the self-corrections was in

1607
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,840
accordance with the act and it explains

1608
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,400
at length why it makes its findings

1609
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:27,040
paragraphs 264 to 284

1610
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,600
so the CIT said that it didn't have to

1611
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,640
determine when jockey first had reason

1612
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,920
to believe since it made no difference

1613
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,199
on that particular set of

1614
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:42,159
facts but it does grapple with and

1615
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:45,520
decide that the D is valid after

1616
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,040
considering the

1617
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,920
arguments now in Jockey as in the

1618
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,880
current case the Importer is not looking

1619
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,679
for a finding on when it first first had

1620
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,400
reason to believe its declarations were

1621
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,800
incorrect as a standalone issue in its

1622
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,560
own

1623
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,560
right uh a genuine 135 action would

1624
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,480
would would take care of that the

1625
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,840
Importer in that case and the plaintiff

1626
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,440
here is seeking to invalidate the

1627
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,760
requirement that it pay retroactive

1628
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,600
duties that's what they're looking for

1629
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,960
the CIT squarely dealt with that issue

1630
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,120
in jockey

1631
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,159
now at paragraph 57 of its factum the

1632
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:31,960
plaintiff says that in its initial

1633
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,239
appeal to the

1634
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:37,159
CIT on the five sampled Goods that were

1635
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:40,320
redetermined under 59 that it did not

1636
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,080
have the power to determine how the

1637
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,320
Tariff classification should ultimately

1638
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,400
impact the appellant with respect to the

1639
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,600
duties imposed so as I see that was in

1640
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,960
the decision regarding the five import

1641
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,760
importation sampled and didn't involve

1642
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,560
uh

1643
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,480
self-corrections or the requirement to

1644
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,960
make

1645
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,320
self-corrections and the C made that

1646
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,040
particular statement in the context of

1647
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,480
discussing any impact an advanced ruling

1648
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,000
issued to a third party would have on

1649
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,040
its

1650
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,120
decision which was

1651
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:17,880
none the CIT did not say that it did not

1652
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,360
have the ability to determine the

1653
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,080
validity of a Das clearly it does have

1654
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,120
that ability based on the case law and

1655
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,560
the jockey case in particular where the

1656
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,080
CIT dealt with virtually the same issue

1657
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,800
as being raised

1658
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:35,199
here finally with respect to jockey I

1659
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,239
would just I would just correct

1660
01:13:37,239 --> 01:13:40,639
paragraph 89 of the plff plaintiff's

1661
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:43,360
factum where it says that the cbsa

1662
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,320
argued in Jockey that it would be for

1663
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,480
the federal court not the CIT to decide

1664
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,239
when the Importer had reason to believe

1665
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:53,199
its declarations were correct if you go

1666
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,920
to the relevant paragraph in the CIT

1667
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,520
decision it's paragraph

1668
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,600
260 uh it is clear that the cbsa makes

1669
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,960
that statement only in describing the

1670
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,040
process of appealing a notice of penalty

1671
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,000
assessment which culminates in a section

1672
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,920
135 action the cbsa was not arguing the

1673
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,080
CIT could not deal with the validity of

1674
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,639
the

1675
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:21,080
Das it did argue that the reason to

1676
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,040
believe was not relevant to the validity

1677
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,760
of the Das but it didn't say

1678
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,480
that uh the CIT cannot deal with that

1679
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,239
and I I'll read the paragraph to make it

1680
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:34,880
clear to the extent here is here is what

1681
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,960
what what it says to the extent that the

1682
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,600
minister of Public Safety and emergency

1683
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,560
preparedness upholds the reason to

1684
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,239
believe finding which underpinned the

1685
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,840
imposition of the penalty the Importer

1686
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,880
can then appeal that decision by way of

1687
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:52,239
an action of the federal court pursuant

1688
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:55,679
to section 135 of the ACT in these

1689
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,239
circumstances the cbsa argued that it

1690
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,040
would be for the federal court not the

1691
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,040
tribunal to decide when the Importer had

1692
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,960
reason to believe that its declarations

1693
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,960
were incorrect so of course in the in

1694
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,520
the circumstances of a 135 action it is

1695
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,920
for the federal court to deal with that

1696
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,960
issue so just

1697
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,120
just just to help me out a little bit

1698
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,080
here on this issue of reason to believe

1699
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,239
a reason to believe is a legitimate

1700
01:15:23,239 --> 01:15:26,400
issue uh before the federal court in a

1701
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,080
135 action or potentially a legitimate

1702
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,159
issue and could also be a legitimate

1703
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:33,840
issue before the

1704
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,840
CIT

1705
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,239
correct I can I can and does that leave

1706
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,679
open the the point that your friend will

1707
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:45,360
make in his submissions that uh that

1708
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,000
that this allows for inconsistent

1709
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,120
decision making uh confusion for the for

1710
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:53,320
in this case the plaintive etc

1711
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:57,199
etc uh no I don't think it does I think

1712
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,120
I think that they can pursue both both

1713
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,280
roots and they deal with different

1714
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,760
aspects and and I mean what we thought

1715
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,280
was going to happen when we agreed to

1716
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,800
the Advance was that they wanted to

1717
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,600
pursue the 135 appeal first and then

1718
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,000
would you know use to the to the extent

1719
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,320
that is helpful use the results of that

1720
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,120
in the other

1721
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:25,760
proceeding so so again that

1722
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,920
perhaps not relevant here um but if that

1723
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,159
were to occur and there were a

1724
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:35,159
conclusion reached in 135 action that uh

1725
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:37,719
the reason to believe finding

1726
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:40,719
was

1727
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,760
incorrect what's the impact on the CIT

1728
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,560
process if if that's if that's what

1729
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,800
occurs in this case in this case or or

1730
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,080
even more generally I'm just looking for

1731
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,000
interal understanding well I do I do

1732
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,520
think that it it very much depends on

1733
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,600
the facts of the case so as we see in in

1734
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,800
the jockey case and we would submit in

1735
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,000
this case and we do in paragraphs I

1736
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,560
believe 71 to 75 of our factum that the

1737
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,120
reason to believe actually has no impact

1738
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,840
on the obligation to go back now there

1739
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:19,520
can be other cases where uh it it may um

1740
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,520
make a difference so my friends refer to

1741
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,560
the policy that cbsa has

1742
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,000
and what is interesting about both the

1743
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,040
jockey case and this case is that the

1744
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:33,440
the timing between the um verification

1745
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,360
period so in this case it was

1746
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:40,120
2015 uh and the date that the report was

1747
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,440
issued is four

1748
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,639
years if we had a case where the the

1749
01:17:45,639 --> 01:17:47,360
time period between those two events was

1750
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,960
two years so for example uh a

1751
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,960
verification period was

1752
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:56,440
2019 and the um verification report was

1753
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,000
issued in

1754
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,320
2021 and there was no uh no issue no

1755
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,920
reason to believe at an earlier date the

1756
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,159
policy says that the Importer is to pay

1757
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:12,520
is to correct duties in the in and pay

1758
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,600
sorry correct importations and pay

1759
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,199
duties during the verification period

1760
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,360
and going forward from that so from in

1761
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,080
that case the policy would indicate it

1762
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:25,120
would be the 2019 2020 21 going forward

1763
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,480
however if there is reason to believe

1764
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,760
they have to go back and correct under

1765
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,239
the policy four

1766
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:35,000
years up to a maximum of four years to

1767
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,560
the date where the where the reason to

1768
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,480
believe First existed so that could mean

1769
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,080
in that case that they have to go back

1770
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,000
from even before the verification period

1771
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,199
to

1772
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:51,800
2017 um so again that that case that

1773
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,800
hypothetical case involves a

1774
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:57,120
verification period of 2019 a report of

1775
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,120
2021 four years back from the report is

1776
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,480
2017 so I I mean I I would I would

1777
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,880
submit that that ALS that illustration

1778
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,199
also

1779
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,560
um

1780
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,679
uh undermines the plaintiff's submission

1781
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:14,920
that our interpretation renders me

1782
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,880
reason to believe in the policy

1783
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,360
meaningless I think I've just

1784
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:21,239
demonstrated that it still does hold so

1785
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:24,760
in a case like that it may it may be

1786
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,719
relevant or it may not be relevant as

1787
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,080
determined by the

1788
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,000
CIT which is their in their purview to

1789
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,199
determine uh whether reason to believe

1790
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:35,800
is is is significant or not but the core

1791
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,800
issue in any case

1792
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,639
is the validity of the Das and whether

1793
01:19:41,639 --> 01:19:44,960
or not uh it was a valid decision to

1794
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,840
make the Importer pay retroactive

1795
01:19:52,639 --> 01:19:56,239
duties all right I'm I'm left with this

1796
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:57,800
with

1797
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,760
this lingering question

1798
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,840
with with respect to this reason to

1799
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,760
believe

1800
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,320
determination

1801
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:09,880
um and the possibility I I acknowledge

1802
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,360
the submissions you make with respect to

1803
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,199
this particular circumstance that

1804
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:17,199
perhaps it's of no no uh consequence uh

1805
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:18,719
given the timelines that we're dealing

1806
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:20,719
with although I think your friend takes

1807
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,480
issue with with the way the policy

1808
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,679
itself has been been uh been interpreted

1809
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,239
perhaps if I've understood the argument

1810
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:30,520
correctly but but the issue the question

1811
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,400
I'm I'm left with with is that the the

1812
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,760
federal court could come to one

1813
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,440
conclusion on the question of reason to

1814
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,280
believe and it remains this very issue

1815
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:44,760
could also be decided by the CIT in a in

1816
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,159
in a separate proceeding that uh that

1817
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:48,520
might well lead to a different

1818
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,719
conclusion and

1819
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,199
uh how how does that issue get resolved

1820
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,760
is that that for the federal court

1821
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,400
appeal to sort out is that is that your

1822
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,320
position

1823
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,199
or the possibility that this could even

1824
01:21:00,199 --> 01:21:04,159
happen C certainly there is a further

1825
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,120
appear appeal to the federal court of

1826
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,080
appeal from the CIT uh decision um on a

1827
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,040
question of law and the recent case of

1828
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,639
Best Buy uh indicates that there's also

1829
01:21:15,639 --> 01:21:17,560
the possibility of a judicial review

1830
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,639
from the

1831
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:22,719
CIT uh in a narrow window that's defined

1832
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,840
in that case and so absolutely abolutely

1833
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,239
if if the timing requires that then they

1834
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:29,719
can pursue that further there and that

1835
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:32,679
would Rectify that or as in as is the

1836
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:35,800
case here um a uh a proceeding may be

1837
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,719
put in

1838
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:41,280
advance all right thank

1839
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:45,199
you um so the case law I've taken you

1840
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:47,600
through um establishes in our view that

1841
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,920
the Customs act scheme indeed deprives

1842
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:53,760
the federal court of the jurisdiction to

1843
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,280
set aside a detailed adjustment

1844
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,040
statement for any

1845
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:02,320
reason um this is further relevant

1846
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,719
because it means that it would not be an

1847
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,400
appropriate remedy in this case for the

1848
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,480
court to order that the action part of

1849
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,320
the action be converted to a judicial

1850
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:16,080
review under rule

1851
01:22:17,639 --> 01:22:20,280
57 or that it be considered a judicial

1852
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,719
review converted to an action under

1853
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:25,960
section 18.4 of the federal courts act

1854
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,800
those remedies may be appropriate in

1855
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,239
some other cases but here it is plain

1856
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,360
and obvious that such an application

1857
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,080
would fail as it did in jocky given the

1858
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,400
scheme under the Customs

1859
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,880
act accordingly the federal court does

1860
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,960
not have jurisdiction to issue an order

1861
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,960
quashing the 2020 Das whether on an

1862
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,600
action or or on a Jr and that paragraph

1863
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:53,159
if it remains should be struck out

1864
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,360
but the plff but the plff cannot obtain

1865
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,760
essentially the same relief it seeks in

1866
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,320
quashing the 2020 Das simply by labeling

1867
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,080
the Customs act duties and interested

1868
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,960
those as damages in the claim as it is

1869
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,840
attempted to

1870
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,480
do despite this different

1871
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:16,400
framing the plaintiff effectively seeks

1872
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,199
to obtain the same remedy of having the

1873
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,280
Das overturned essentially nullifying

1874
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,120
its

1875
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:27,679
effect the purpose of the July 2020 Das

1876
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:30,840
is to directly impose duties essentially

1877
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,760
imposing

1878
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,840
ax on the

1879
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,320
plaintiff having those duties reimbursed

1880
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,960
to it as damages has the same effect as

1881
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,040
overturning the decision that impos them

1882
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,280
draining it of legal

1883
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,320
effect as we've seen it's before the CIT

1884
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,719
and onto the federal court of appeal

1885
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:51,760
under the Customs act scheme that the

1886
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,600
plff must pursue its challenge to the

1887
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,560
Das and SE to overturn it not the

1888
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,040
federal

1889
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:01,600
court the federal court has held that it

1890
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,719
may strike a statement of

1891
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:07,760
claim if it's essential character in an

1892
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,239
application that is an application for

1893
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,199
judicial review with only a thin

1894
01:24:12,199 --> 01:24:14,679
pretense to a private

1895
01:24:14,679 --> 01:24:17,239
wrong and we say the same thing applies

1896
01:24:17,239 --> 01:24:19,520
here where it's properly an appeal to

1897
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,719
the

1898
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,639
CIT another Public Law remedy which

1899
01:24:23,639 --> 01:24:27,080
replaces the judicial review

1900
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,600
option the court States this for example

1901
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,639
in the in the recent Leone case and the

1902
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:35,440
Stewart case those are at tabs 34 and 50

1903
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,960
for your reference uh and those cases

1904
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,760
cite the Supreme Court decision in

1905
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,679
telone to that

1906
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,760
effect in the current matter the

1907
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,880
essential character of the claim is a

1908
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,119
challenge to the 2020 Das which must be

1909
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:51,000
taken to the CIT under the Customs act

1910
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
scheme

1911
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,560
we submit the pretense in this case is

1912
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,880
very thin indeed the pl of seeks in

1913
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,400
essence to undo what was done by

1914
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,920
overturning the Das or having it effect

1915
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,800
effectively nullified the fresh as

1916
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,159
amended statement of claim

1917
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:13,520
until its recent suggested Amendment

1918
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,199
explicitly seeks an order quashing as

1919
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:18,719
unreasonable the July 2020

1920
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:22,360
D it also describes the cbsa decision as

1921
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,320
the unreasonable imposition of ret

1922
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,080
retroactive duties and it claims it

1923
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,440
should not have been required to pay the

1924
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,199
retroactive duties set

1925
01:25:30,199 --> 01:25:32,719
out in the 2020

1926
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:36,320
death as I said uh earlier uh when the

1927
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,119
plan of provided uh the proposed

1928
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:41,840
amendment in November removing paragraph

1929
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,880
1A of the claim um we submit that such a

1930
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,639
proposed amendment is merely

1931
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:50,440
cosmetic and it just removes a

1932
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,560
signpost but does not change the

1933
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,239
essential character of the claim

1934
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,920
with its original amendments to its

1935
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,719
original statement of

1936
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,639
claim the plan of added allegations that

1937
01:26:03,639 --> 01:26:07,080
the cbsa breached a duty of care to the

1938
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,600
pl by treating the plaintive differently

1939
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,000
from other importers by imposing

1940
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,239
retroactive duties following a trade

1941
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:15,760
compliance

1942
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,000
verification by imposing retroactive

1943
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,320
duties in a manner inconsistent with the

1944
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,719
representations of a cbsa

1945
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,480
director and in osing and by imposing

1946
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,280
retroactive duties in a manner

1947
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,760
inconsistent with the cbsa policies

1948
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,960
based on these allegations the plaintiff

1949
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,880
claims that is entitled to damages in

1950
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,040
the exact amount of the duties and

1951
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,760
interest it says was errone it was

1952
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,840
erroneously required to

1953
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,679
pay the plaintiff simply disagrees with

1954
01:26:44,679 --> 01:26:47,199
the cvsa determination that it is

1955
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:49,480
required to pay duties and interests on

1956
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:52,800
import importations from 2015 to

1957
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,800
2018 the Ed breaches are merely ways the

1958
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,199
plaintiff feels the decision was

1959
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,639
unreasonable such that it be set aside

1960
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:02,560
or

1961
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,520
nullified it is not content to let that

1962
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,440
decision stand as plaintiffs were in

1963
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,800
other cases that were allowed to proceed

1964
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,080
his

1965
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,920
actions for example this is a far cry

1966
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,440
from the claim at issue in

1967
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:23,400
telone in that case telone brought an

1968
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,760
action against

1969
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,320
Canada seeking compensation for

1970
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,600
financial losses it incurred when Canada

1971
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,719
in its view improperly refused to Grant

1972
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,560
it a

1973
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,880
license the action was for breach of

1974
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,920
contract negligence and unjust

1975
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,400
enrichment and sought compensation for

1976
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,840
losses pisone did not seek to overturn

1977
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,000
the decision granting licenses only to

1978
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,159
others or seek to limit its legal effect

1979
01:27:55,159 --> 01:27:57,480
the case also did not involve a tax-

1980
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,480
likee situation where the

1981
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,280
decision itself directly required the

1982
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,280
plaintiff to pay money which the

1983
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,400
plaintiff then sought reimbursement for

1984
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,239
which is the case here so if I

1985
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,440
understand your submission if if the

1986
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:15,320
plaintiff had framed or framed the

1987
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:19,440
damage claim in this case in the context

1988
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,159
of some future loss that's resulted from

1989
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:24,719
this this assessment speaking very

1990
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:26,280
hypothetically here I don't know if if

1991
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,840
that's possible or not uh your objection

1992
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,800
would disappear is that is that what

1993
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,040
what I understand the uh the submission

1994
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,239
to me the objection is the way the

1995
01:28:35,239 --> 01:28:37,360
damages have been framed damages has

1996
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,840
been framed in a manner that clearly

1997
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,960
indicates that they're linked at least

1998
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,600
based on your submission to the Tariff

1999
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,600
and the retroactive tariff uh repayment

2000
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,199
that's required um had those damages

2001
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:53,440
been been framed in some other manner

2002
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:57,440
that suggested some future loss um I

2003
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,040
take it the objection would disappear is

2004
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,320
that is

2005
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,639
that I would put it slightly differently

2006
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,639
I I I would say that they are they are

2007
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,920
accurately framed to the extent that

2008
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,360
they are labeled as the duties and

2009
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,159
interest because that is exactly what

2010
01:29:11,159 --> 01:29:14,719
this claim is trying to do um if it were

2011
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,199
uh

2012
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:20,159
um so I I don't I don't I don't know if

2013
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,800
it's a matter of framing I mean I think

2014
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,600
if it concerned something else

2015
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,719
um it it's possible depending on what it

2016
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:29,800
was hypothetically that that that that

2017
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,239
that would be different but at any

2018
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:35,400
rate it's not those those damages which

2019
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,960
are the ones that I'm dealing with right

2020
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,840
now are not like tesone damages they are

2021
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,920
taxes that the decision directly

2022
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,719
imposed and

2023
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:51,760
uh and by seeking those damages those

2024
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,560
amounts which I think are accurately

2025
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,040
set out as being the duty amounts uh the

2026
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:01,040
the uh the plaintiff seeks to overturn

2027
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,280
that decision either literally by

2028
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,719
quashing it or effectively by having

2029
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:08,360
those amounts

2030
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:11,320
reimbursed uh I think the language at

2031
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,719
paragraph 79 of the of the Supreme

2032
01:30:13,719 --> 01:30:18,080
Court's decision in tazone is helpful um

2033
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,960
that that's at toab 13 uh of our book

2034
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,400
um and I'll just I'll just go through

2035
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,119
part of it um sorry tab tab 13 did you

2036
01:30:28,119 --> 01:30:31,159
say that's correct and it's page 318 of

2037
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:34,040
the P I've got it yes go ahead uh tazone

2038
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,639
is not attempting to nullify or set

2039
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,639
aside The Minister's order its case is

2040
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:41,560
that the minister in deciding not to

2041
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:44,080
issue a license to tazone acted in

2042
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,239
breach of his contractual and Equitable

2043
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,639
duties or in breach of a duty of care

2044
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,679
telone does not say that The Minister's

2045
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:52,239
decision should be

2046
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,719
quashed on the contrary

2047
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,199
Tone's causes of action in contract tort

2048
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:59,400
and Equity are predicated on the

2049
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,080
finality of that decision excluding tone

2050
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:02,920
from

2051
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,560
participating from participation in the

2052
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,119
Telecommunications Market thereby

2053
01:31:08,119 --> 01:31:10,719
causing it Financial loss nor does

2054
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:12,840
tazone seek to deprive The Minister's

2055
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,760
decision of any legal effect it does not

2056
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,119
challenge the licenses issued to its

2057
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:21,040
competitors it does not seek to undo

2058
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,159
what was

2059
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,719
done the plaintive in this Case by

2060
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:28,040
contrast does seek to undo what was done

2061
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,440
whether directly under the pretense whe

2062
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:31,800
whether directly or under the pretense

2063
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,679
of a damage is claim it does seek to

2064
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:39,000
deprive the decision at issue of legal

2065
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,880
effect uh I would also say that the the

2066
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,440
current matter is also different from

2067
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,800
the negligence claim in parody honey

2068
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,800
this the negligence claim in parody

2069
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,199
honey that the federal court of appeal

2070
01:31:50,199 --> 01:31:51,679
refused to

2071
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:54,119
strike the plainist in that case were

2072
01:31:54,119 --> 01:31:57,080
beekeepers who brought a class action

2073
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,840
claim in negligence against Canada the

2074
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,920
claim was based on a Minister's decision

2075
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,520
to impose a blanket ban on the

2076
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:07,239
importation of specific honeybee

2077
01:32:07,239 --> 01:32:09,520
packages despite having no lawful

2078
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,800
authority to do so and his refusal to

2079
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,000
consider even consider uh permit

2080
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,040
applications uh the claim was for

2081
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,960
resulting losses and damages to

2082
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,840
beekeepers who relied on the B package

2083
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,320
Imports to sustain stain their

2084
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,600
beekeeping

2085
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,840
businesses here again the plaintiffs did

2086
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,800
not seek to overturn or undo the refusal

2087
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,440
to issue importation perits and here

2088
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,040
again the decision that issue did not

2089
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,920
directly require the plaintiffs to pay

2090
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,480
money that they sought reimbursement for

2091
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,159
wasn't a tax- likee

2092
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:48,719
situation in contrast to those two

2093
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,960
cases is the Federal Court decision in

2094
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,920
flaro that's at tab 18 te you for your

2095
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,400
reference in that

2096
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,800
case the plaintiffs brought an action

2097
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,440
under Section 17 of the federal courts

2098
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,040
act seeking a declaration that the

2099
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,199
defendant was unlawfully detaining funds

2100
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:11,800
that had been seized pursuant to the

2101
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,920
exis

2102
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,960
Act and the claim sought damages in the

2103
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,040
amount of the seized

2104
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,679
funds the court dismissed the claim it

2105
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:24,480
found that the for for

2106
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,000
of the funds should have been challenged

2107
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,040
through the specific statutory review

2108
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,560
mechanism set out in the exis ACT which

2109
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,400
was app applicable in that case and that

2110
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:38,560
the funds could not be recovered as

2111
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:43,320
damages the court States at paragraph

2112
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,920
76 these plaintiffs seek the same remedy

2113
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,679
they may have received had they followed

2114
01:33:48,679 --> 01:33:51,440
the statutary process for review by the

2115
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,040
minister considering that they failed to

2116
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,400
resource under those Provisions it would

2117
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,159
undermine parliament's intent to not now

2118
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:01,000
allow the plaintiffs to wait out the

2119
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,400
time limits and seek the same remedy in

2120
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,880
the federal court they should have

2121
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,320
sought before they should have sought

2122
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,600
from the

2123
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,800
minister they should have followed the

2124
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,560
scheme in the ACT rather than bringing

2125
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,199
in action for

2126
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,800
damages if the current plti were

2127
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,119
successful on an appeal to the

2128
01:34:22,119 --> 01:34:24,960
CIT it's obl obligation to pay duties

2129
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,960
and interest on the importations would

2130
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:27,719
be

2131
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:30,679
removed and any duties and interest paid

2132
01:34:30,679 --> 01:34:32,960
reimbursed it would get the same remedy

2133
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,760
with respect to duties and interests it

2134
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,080
seeks

2135
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,520
here it can't be that where an importer

2136
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,880
disagrees it should have to pay duties

2137
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,800
taxes imposed on it by a Das that it can

2138
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,360
circumvent the statutory scheme put in

2139
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,800
place by Parliament by calling the

2140
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:53,920
duties damages and bringing an action

2141
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,520
the defendant submits it's plain and

2142
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,280
obvious that the plaintiff's framing the

2143
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,040
claim for duties and interests as

2144
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,360
damages does not change the fact that

2145
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,480
the claim's essential character is a

2146
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,080
challenge to the Das which must be

2147
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,199
brought to

2148
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:08,520
CIT it does not have the essential

2149
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,960
character of a private

2150
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,159
wrong accordingly the portions of the

2151
01:35:13,159 --> 01:35:15,159
statement of claims seeking damages for

2152
01:35:15,159 --> 01:35:17,119
duties and interest as a result of the

2153
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:19,880
breach of Duty of care should be struck

2154
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,280
as being outside this Court's

2155
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,679
Jurisdiction and disclosing not

2156
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:26,480
reasonable cause of

2157
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:32,280
action uh I I'll now turn to the

2158
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,800
plaintiff's claim for damages and the

2159
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,199
amount of Duties and

2160
01:35:36,199 --> 01:35:38,440
interest on the basis of the parody

2161
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,880
honey

2162
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
case just before I just see we're at

2163
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,800
we're we're at about 1105 here

2164
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,560
um thinking of a a break how much longer

2165
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,880
do you think you're going to be Mr

2166
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:54,760
mbacham I don't think I should be uh too

2167
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:56,960
much longer it's probably best to have a

2168
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,239
break between myself and my colle okay

2169
01:35:59,239 --> 01:36:00,840
and that's fine

2170
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,280
great I'll try to move as quickly as I

2171
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,639
can

2172
01:36:05,639 --> 01:36:08,520
um uh the the plain if's pleading of

2173
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:11,159
breach of public law

2174
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:14,440
duties referencing parody honey does not

2175
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,880
affect the essential character of the

2176
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:17,760
plain's claim with respect to the duties

2177
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,320
in interest or the fact that it

2178
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:24,239
challenge must be pursued at the CIT

2179
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:25,920
um as I'm sure you're familiar with the

2180
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,320
majority in parody honey contemplated in

2181
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:31,840
obiter the notion of a claim for

2182
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,239
monetary relief in public law as an

2183
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:36,000
alternative to what the courts have been

2184
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,520
doing which is applying private law

2185
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,840
concepts of negligence to governments

2186
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,880
with various

2187
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,119
adaptations uh the notion of such a

2188
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:47,320
claim or cause of action has not since

2189
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:50,440
been taken up by the courts in fact two

2190
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,119
months ago the Supreme Court in the

2191
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:55,960
Nelson versus marchie decision which we

2192
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:58,400
uh filed after it was

2193
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,719
issued um rejected the

2194
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:05,639
concept at paragraph 41 the Supreme

2195
01:37:05,639 --> 01:37:08,239
Court States in reference to the

2196
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,239
approach proposed in par

2197
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:13,119
honey quote such an approach has no

2198
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:16,520
basis in this Court's Juris Juris such

2199
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,400
an approach has no basis in this Court's

2200
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:22,000
jurist Prudence it also runs counter to

2201
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,400
Crown proceedings legisl in Canada which

2202
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,639
subjects the crown to liability as if it

2203
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:29,600
were a private

2204
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,880
person it rejects the notion of such a

2205
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,760
cause of action as as articula and

2206
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:37,000
parody honey and the federal court has

2207
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,679
already acknowledged this disapproval of

2208
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:42,760
parody honey in in telis Communications

2209
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:45,560
versus Videotron which we also passed up

2210
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:46,880
and just for your reference it's at

2211
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,360
paragraph 84 that it makes that

2212
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:52,920
statement we submit that this rejection

2213
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,880
by the Supreme court is sufficient to

2214
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,480
strike the plaintiff's claims based on

2215
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,800
parody

2216
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,760
honey in any event with respect to the

2217
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,920
duties and interest damages claimed

2218
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,840
under that

2219
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,719
head it's our submission that the

2220
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:11,760
plaintiff's claim uh does not even fit

2221
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,360
within the framework contemplated by the

2222
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,040
federal court of

2223
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,159
appeal the majority in parity honey made

2224
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,320
clear that in some cases an award of

2225
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,800
monetary relief will be neither

2226
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,280
necessary nor appropriate

2227
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:27,040
but paragraph 143 of that

2228
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,800
decision just as Stratus States the

2229
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,719
compensatory objective of monetary

2230
01:38:31,719 --> 01:38:34,840
relief must be kept front of mind so in

2231
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:36,840
some cases the quashing of decision or

2232
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,960
the enjoining or prohibition of conduct

2233
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,920
will suffice and monetary relief will

2234
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,239
neither be necessary nor

2235
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:47,560
appropriate the present

2236
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:50,280
case as it relates to uh duties and

2237
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:53,560
interest damages is such a case an award

2238
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,080
of monetary relief is neither necessary

2239
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,000
nor

2240
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,520
appropriate the plan does not seek to be

2241
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,000
compensated for economic losses that

2242
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,840
flow Downstream when it seeks damages in

2243
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,440
the amount of Duties and

2244
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,119
interest it doesn't flow Downstream from

2245
01:39:10,119 --> 01:39:12,400
the cbsa decision to oppose duties it

2246
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,119
seeks to have the duties themselves

2247
01:39:14,119 --> 01:39:17,040
effectively nullify this is the type of

2248
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,679
case that Justice Stratus describes in

2249
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:23,440
Canada versus Oshkosh

2250
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,960
where the administrative remedies will

2251
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,199
quote have the direct effect of

2252
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:32,000
requiring that monies be paid and the

2253
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,920
return of the monies paid or owing under

2254
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,599
the decision is the inexorable

2255
01:39:36,599 --> 01:39:39,599
consequence of quashing the decision if

2256
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:41,440
as I said if the plan follows the only

2257
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,760
appropriate route to challenge the Das

2258
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,520
and is successful on appeal to the CIT

2259
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,400
its obligation to pay the duties in

2260
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,280
interest would be removed and any

2261
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,360
payments reimbursed accordingly the pl

2262
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,080
claim for monetary relief in public law

2263
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,480
is neither necessary nor

2264
01:39:58,599 --> 01:40:00,840
appropriate ultimately letting the pl of

2265
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,400
proceed with its action for the duties

2266
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:05,080
and interests imposed by the Das in

2267
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:07,000
either negligence or a claim for breach

2268
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,159
of public law duties would frustrate

2269
01:40:09,159 --> 01:40:11,280
parliament's intention as to how these

2270
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,760
matters are to be

2271
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,800
determined it's claim for duties and

2272
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,840
interests owing as damages going from

2273
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:23,239
either cause of action should be struck

2274
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:26,639
um I should be fairly quick with the

2275
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:28,719
rest of my submissions

2276
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:30,960
um we will rely on our written

2277
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,199
submissions with regard to our

2278
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,159
alternative argument that claiming

2279
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:37,400
Customs act duties and interest as

2280
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,080
damages constitutes a collateral attack

2281
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:40,920
on the

2282
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,560
Das

2283
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:46,000
um suffices to say the plane if if

2284
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,520
allowed to do so would have achieve

2285
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,040
through through what it through

2286
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,440
collateral attack what it can only

2287
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,679
properly seek to achieve by pursuing an

2288
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:55,440
appeal to the C

2289
01:40:55,599 --> 01:40:59,560
it um to sum up the various parts of our

2290
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:02,119
jurisdiction argument on the claim as it

2291
01:41:02,119 --> 01:41:04,920
relates to duties and interests imposed

2292
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:05,840
by the

2293
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,960
Das first the court cannot quash a

2294
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,639
decision in an action but only in a

2295
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:14,520
Jr second the court cannot even do that

2296
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,840
here as the Customs act sets out an

2297
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,760
appeal scheme that out the jurisdiction

2298
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,159
of the court to overturn a Das for any

2299
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:25,000
reason including its validity

2300
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
the federal court doesn't have

2301
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
jurisdiction to deal with these matters

2302
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,239
the only way to challenge Das is through

2303
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:31,639
the

2304
01:41:31,639 --> 01:41:33,840
CIT third the plaintiff's attempt to

2305
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,760
characterize tax- likee duties as

2306
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,119
damages does not change the fact that in

2307
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:41,360
its Essence the claim seeks to nullify

2308
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,159
the cbsa Das something that can only be

2309
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:47,080
done by way of an appeal to the

2310
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:49,520
CIT and the plff can follow that route

2311
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,639
in this case all it has to do is take

2312
01:41:51,639 --> 01:41:55,880
its CIT appeal out of

2313
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:00,480
abeyance I'll now briefly address two of

2314
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:04,199
uh my friends arguments from their

2315
01:42:04,199 --> 01:42:07,280
factum which I haven't yet touched on

2316
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:09,040
first the plaintiff argues that if our

2317
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,920
position were accepted it would mean the

2318
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:13,280
plaintiff would have to pursue multiple

2319
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,199
proceedings it argues this would be

2320
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:17,360
impractical inefficient overly

2321
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,679
complicated encounter to the priority

2322
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:21,800
given to access to

2323
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:24,239
Justice to this argument we simply

2324
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:27,239
respond that as we have seen with the

2325
01:42:27,239 --> 01:42:29,520
Customs act Parliament has set out two

2326
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,920
separate appeal schemes one for

2327
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,760
challenging penalties assessed under the

2328
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,480
ACT which culminates in an action to the

2329
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,920
federal court and a separate one for

2330
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,960
challenging a Das which goes to the CIT

2331
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,040
federal court of appeal and Os the

2332
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,520
jurisdiction of the federal

2333
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:48,560
court in answer to paragraph 102 of the

2334
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,320
plain's factum which sets out to the

2335
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,119
various proceedings they say our

2336
01:42:52,119 --> 01:42:53,639
argument would

2337
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:56,159
require we say that yes the plaintiff

2338
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:59,480
must pursue a section 135 action to

2339
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,920
challenge The Minister's decision

2340
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:03,040
upholding the penalty assessment that's

2341
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,840
required by the

2342
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,159
ACT if the plaintiff had legitimate

2343
01:43:07,159 --> 01:43:09,480
damages claims properly pursued by way

2344
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:13,000
of an action unlike the ones here these

2345
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,239
could be joined to the 135

2346
01:43:15,239 --> 01:43:17,719
action we say that yes the plaintiff

2347
01:43:17,719 --> 01:43:20,360
must pursue a separate Jr to challenge

2348
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,520
the amount of the penalty as the case

2349
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:24,400
law has shown in the ACT

2350
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,440
requires and yes the plff must pursue an

2351
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,440
appeal to the CIT to challenge the July

2352
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:33,159
2020 Das in the duties it imposed as

2353
01:43:33,159 --> 01:43:34,639
we've argued

2354
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,199
today plan if doesn't have to pursue

2355
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:38,560
them all at the same time proceedings

2356
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,280
can be put in advance but these are the

2357
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,199
routes that must be

2358
01:43:42,199 --> 01:43:44,800
followed the plan if points to the break

2359
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,639
case which discusses consolidating a

2360
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:49,760
judicial review application and an

2361
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,400
action in the interest of access to

2362
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:53,560
Justice

2363
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,960
however that case and that discussion

2364
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:59,080
did not involve a statutory scheme set

2365
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:01,679
up by Parliament to deal with the issue

2366
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:03,400
which outs the jurisdiction of the

2367
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:06,119
federal court Parliament has has done

2368
01:44:06,119 --> 01:44:08,000
that here under the Customs act so that

2369
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,920
case is not

2370
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:13,199
instructed the plaintiff cannot ask the

2371
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:15,280
court to ignore parliament's intent the

2372
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:18,080
Customs act the federal courts Act and

2373
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,400
the Juris prence of this court the

2374
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:23,280
courts above to reduce the number

2375
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,679
proceedings it has to

2376
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:28,199
follow this brings me to the related

2377
01:44:28,199 --> 01:44:30,800
assertion by the plaintiffs that all of

2378
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,560
these proceedings would turn on the same

2379
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,599
issue of reason to believe this is not

2380
01:44:35,599 --> 01:44:37,560
the case and we we did touch on this

2381
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:41,239
briefly in reference to the Jo

2382
01:44:41,239 --> 01:44:43,960
decision uh whether the minister so to

2383
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,159
go through the proceedings whether the

2384
01:44:45,159 --> 01:44:46,760
minister properly upheld the notice of

2385
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:49,159
penalty assessment could hinge on reason

2386
01:44:49,159 --> 01:44:51,599
to believe the amount of the of the

2387
01:44:51,599 --> 01:44:54,159
penalty and a challenge that by way of

2388
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:56,639
Jr would not hinge on reason to believe

2389
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:58,239
it would hinge on the reasonableness of

2390
01:44:58,239 --> 01:44:59,880
the

2391
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,440
penalty and as I as I said whether the

2392
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:05,040
plff had earlier reason to believe would

2393
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,560
also not determine the validity of the

2394
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,320
Das and the requirement to pay

2395
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:11,560
retroactive duties which is at the heart

2396
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:14,320
of this claim as I referenced we set at

2397
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,840
our arguments there at at paragraphs 71

2398
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,360
to 75 of our written

2399
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:22,440
submissions the the plaintiff May

2400
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,480
characterize the requirement to pay the

2401
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,880
retroactive duties as being about reason

2402
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,560
to believe but that doesn't make it so

2403
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,320
the applant and jockey also characterize

2404
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:35,080
the validity of retroactive payments as

2405
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,199
centering on reason to believe in that

2406
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:41,159
case the CIT

2407
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,840
disagreed the CIT has to be given the

2408
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:49,280
opportunity in the scheme to make that

2409
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,400
determination now whether reason to

2410
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:53,119
believe ultimately determines the

2411
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:56,199
validity of the Das is not an aspect

2412
01:45:56,199 --> 01:45:59,040
that the court has to determine on this

2413
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,040
motion I just make these arguments uh to

2414
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,280
undermine the plain of assertion that

2415
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:05,719
everything ought to be dealt with in one

2416
01:46:05,719 --> 01:46:08,159
single

2417
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,840
proceeding um my friend will continue

2418
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,840
our submissions uh subject to any

2419
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,920
questions those are our submissions on

2420
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:19,320
the issues that I I'm dealing with today

2421
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:23,440
just just so um

2422
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,000
just to help me out a little bit here

2423
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,639
based on the jurisdiction arguments that

2424
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:30,560
you've just Advanced um what specific

2425
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,159
paragraphs and sub paragraphs of the

2426
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:36,800
amended state of claim uh are you

2427
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,599
submitting should be struck on the basis

2428
01:46:38,599 --> 01:46:41,480
solely of those arguments I expect

2429
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:43,520
there's going to be overlap but uh I'd

2430
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,840
like to like you to identify

2431
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,320
specifically what the jurisdiction

2432
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,000
argument would uh would strike without

2433
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,280
consideration of the the other

2434
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,679
submissions that will be made right I'll

2435
01:46:52,679 --> 01:46:55,719
just go through the

2436
01:46:55,719 --> 01:47:00,159
uh so certainly paragraph 1

2437
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:02,760
a

2438
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,280
yes paragraph

2439
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,800
1D take the clear ones first so uh in

2440
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,760
paragraph

2441
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:22,360
67 did you say paragraph 1B or 1 C uh I

2442
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:24,920
I one a and One

2443
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:27,920
D

2444
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:35,239
DAV uh and then in 67 the parallel

2445
01:47:35,239 --> 01:47:38,239
portions

2446
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:48,599
um so 67 uh 1 c i and double I

2447
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:01,760
all right uh and then so those are the

2448
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:06,199
easy ones uh then if we go to with

2449
01:48:06,199 --> 01:48:08,440
little

2450
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:14,960
overlap

2451
01:48:15,159 --> 01:48:18,719
uh section V so paragraphs

2452
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:24,000
46 to uh 60

2453
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,360
all rely on parody

2454
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:28,800
honey and so we submit that given the

2455
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,599
Supreme Court's rejection of that

2456
01:48:30,599 --> 01:48:33,880
approach all of those should be struck

2457
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,599
regardless of what relief they're

2458
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:38,040
pertaining

2459
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:45,159
to

2460
01:48:45,159 --> 01:48:49,320
um and so I I I think I I can maybe

2461
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,080
double check in the break but I think

2462
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:53,920
that the the remainder of the breach of

2463
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,159
Duty of care

2464
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:59,239
um there will be overlap as to what

2465
01:48:59,239 --> 01:49:04,119
relief it it uh it relates

2466
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,599
to thank you if if there's anything that

2467
01:49:07,599 --> 01:49:09,080
you want to update on after the break

2468
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:14,280
then you can certainly do that thank

2469
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:16,920
you all right uh thank you for those

2470
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:19,840
submissions um so with that uh before we

2471
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,400
turn

2472
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:24,520

2480
01:49:49,239 --> 01:49:53,280
morning uh justice gleon so of I will

2481
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,760
address the second part of our motion

2482
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,520
which relates uh more to the the private

2483
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:01,800
law part of the statement of claim so I

2484
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:04,639
want to go through address with you uh

2485
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:07,440
four main points the first one being

2486
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,119
that there's no uh they can be no

2487
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:11,880
reasonable of cause of action in

2488
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,760
negligence regarding both the duties and

2489
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:17,920
the rest of the the other heads of

2490
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,360
Damages the second point that the

2491
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:22,960
professional fees cannot Grant found a

2492
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,320
claim in Damages and this claim and

2493
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,400
disclose no reasonable cause of action

2494
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:30,679
and um amounts also to an abuse of

2495
01:50:30,679 --> 01:50:34,000
process and should be struck third um I

2496
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,639
will address how in the respon the the

2497
01:50:37,639 --> 01:50:40,760
defendant VI the unspecified $1 million

2498
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:43,280
in general damages uh is not pleaded

2499
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,760
properly and should be struck as well

2500
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,159
and finally I will address a few words

2501
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:51,159
um I will give a response to the estole

2502
01:50:51,159 --> 01:50:53,520
argument that was raised by uh the

2503
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,560
plaintiff in their written

2504
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:59,079
submissions so um I invite you to uh to

2505
01:50:59,079 --> 01:51:00,639
uh interrupt me if you have any

2506
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:03,119
questions or if you didn't hear me well

2507
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:06,239
or if I'm going too fast I will be glad

2508
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:09,679
to uh respond to your concern um of

2509
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:12,480
course just as to give you a bit more uh

2510
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:15,560
information on this road mapping I think

2511
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:17,440
uh depending on your questions and how

2512
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,480
it goes I think the bulk of my

2513
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,000
submissions will uh concentrate on the

2514
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,679
first point which is about the the duty

2515
01:51:24,679 --> 01:51:27,000
of care uh the absence of a duty of care

2516
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,320
in this

2517
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:33,239
case uh so um so moving on to my first

2518
01:51:33,239 --> 01:51:35,040
point that there can be no cause of

2519
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,719
action in negligence um the most

2520
01:51:37,719 --> 01:51:39,599
important points that I will highlight

2521
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:40,639
during my

2522
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:43,480
submissions uh are that there can be no

2523
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:46,159
proximity relationship between importers

2524
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:46,920
and

2525
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:51,119
cbsa when CB when the cbsa um conducts

2526
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:55,320
verification and imposes uh duties on

2527
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:57,679
importers and this is based mainly on

2528
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:00,639
the very nature of the custom

2529
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:04,400
scheme uh another point in that uh I

2530
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:07,639
will also address that uh even if a

2531
01:52:07,639 --> 01:52:10,520
prima a DF care would be uh would be

2532
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:13,360
identified by the court strong policy

2533
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,280
considerations would negate it in any

2534
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,760
event and those are uh the risk of

2535
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:22,560
indefinite liability but also um the

2536
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,440
circumvention of a specific multi-level

2537
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,239
appeal scheme that was set out by

2538
01:52:27,239 --> 01:52:30,599
Parliament that my colleague Mr noban

2539
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:34,040
told you in details about earlier uh so

2540
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:36,880
throughout my submissions uh justice gon

2541
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:39,440
I hope to demonstrate that this motion

2542
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:42,639
to strike uh is indeed appropriate to

2543
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:45,199
strike this claim and

2544
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:48,280
negligence um early on as this court has

2545
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:52,040
often done so in other cases and I will

2546
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,760
uh discuss these cases as I go through

2547
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:55,760
my

2548
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,960
submission so uh I won't I don't want to

2549
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:02,119
do a fullon

2550
01:53:02,119 --> 01:53:04,239
um I don't want to go into too much

2551
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:06,480
details on the law of negligence I think

2552
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:09,960
we all know uh the basic element of it

2553
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,880
um you know you have to identify a duty

2554
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:15,159
of care a standard of care and a breach

2555
01:53:15,159 --> 01:53:18,280
of that standard of care uh I think that

2556
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:20,360
here we submit that here the issue is

2557
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:23,000
really about uh the first element

2558
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,880
uh the recognition or the identification

2559
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:30,520
of the duty of care so um unfortunately

2560
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:33,400
for this court uh I at least to my

2561
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,360
knowledge there's no there has been no

2562
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:38,880
uh Court decision that will pine on a uh

2563
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,920
the presence or not of a duty of care

2564
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:44,119
between the cbsa and

2565
01:53:44,119 --> 01:53:47,400
importers um so I think so on a motion

2566
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,800
to strike I think the question that you

2567
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:53,480
have to ask yourself is um

2568
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,159
is it plain and obvious that the

2569
01:53:55,159 --> 01:53:58,800
plaintiff's claim uh for ident

2570
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:01,159
identifying a new duty of care is bound

2571
01:54:01,159 --> 01:54:02,000
to

2572
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,599
fail um so as I said it's never been

2573
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:08,280
recognized before in the case law so we

2574
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:12,239
have to uh revert to the test that was

2575
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:15,000
uh developed by the court and refined

2576
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,840
over a number of significant years and

2577
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,760
decades and that test involves two

2578
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:24,000
question the first one being do the

2579
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,880
facts um as pleaded disclose a

2580
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,119
relationship of proximity in which

2581
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:32,040
failure to take reasonable care might be

2582
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:34,599
foreseeably might foreseeably cause a

2583
01:54:34,599 --> 01:54:37,679
loss or harm to the

2584
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:42,440
plaintiff and so if uh so this this is

2585
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:44,239
this is this first part is interested in

2586
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:48,159
the proximity relationship but also the

2587
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:51,440
foreseeability uh and so if uh a praachi

2588
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:56,079
duty of care is is indeed identified um

2589
01:54:56,079 --> 01:54:58,599
the court must ask itself are there any

2590
01:54:58,599 --> 01:55:00,920
residual policy considerations that

2591
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:03,000
would that would negate uh the

2592
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
recognition of a duty of

2593
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,280
care so uh of course we uh our arguments

2594
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:12,480
are only cover the proximity uh

2595
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:15,840
relationship the proximity analysis and

2596
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:18,560
so um the proximity this proximity

2597
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,719
relationship has been or inquiry has

2598
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:23,119
been referred to as um you have to look

2599
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:26,400
at the quality of the relationship uh

2600
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:29,239
between the parties uh and whether or

2601
01:55:29,239 --> 01:55:31,119
not that makes it fair and reasonable to

2602
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:33,119
impose a duty of care in the

2603
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:36,239
circumstances of the case uh on uh a

2604
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:37,159
certain

2605
01:55:37,159 --> 01:55:39,599
party it has been said in other words

2606
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:41,719
that uh this relationship has to be

2607
01:55:41,719 --> 01:55:44,840
close and direct

2608
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:49,679
enough um of course here we are

2609
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:54,079
uh we are uh with a an importer so a

2610
01:55:54,079 --> 01:55:56,760
private person against a Public

2611
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:59,760
Authority uh which is the cbsa in this

2612
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:03,400
case um so and the courts have said many

2613
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:06,239
times that in the case of uh identifying

2614
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:09,280
a duty of Care on uh and impose it on a

2615
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:12,679
Public Authority such as the cbsa um the

2616
01:56:12,679 --> 01:56:14,520
statutes and the words of the statutes

2617
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,800
and the purpose and objectives of the

2618
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:19,520
statutes are Paramount in that um

2619
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,760
private law analysis

2620
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:24,719
uh so it has been said that a duty of

2621
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:27,880
care may arise from uh the statutory

2622
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:30,679
scheme itself so we have to look at that

2623
01:56:30,679 --> 01:56:33,239
it may also arise from specific

2624
01:56:33,239 --> 01:56:35,800
interactions between the Public

2625
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:40,040
Authority and the plaintiff um but only

2626
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,960
if it's not clearly negated by

2627
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:45,560
Statute um and this is all set out in

2628
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:48,199
the cases that we cited the seminal case

2629
01:56:48,199 --> 01:56:52,679
of RV Imperial tobacco and uh it was was

2630
01:56:52,679 --> 01:56:56,800
uh very recently uh summarized and

2631
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,320
discussed by the Ontario Court of Appeal

2632
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:00,320
in

2633
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:04,800
200 uh 21 in the case of Charles Fort

2634
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:08,159
developments limited V the city of

2635
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:09,920
Ottawa

2636
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:14,199
um so here the Ronk or the plaintiff

2637
01:57:14,199 --> 01:57:17,159
claims that a duty of care arises from

2638
01:57:17,159 --> 01:57:19,840
uh six different elements they are

2639
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:23,800
listed at uh paragraph 6 1 of their

2640
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:27,560
amended statement of claim okay so uh

2641
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:29,360
unless you you want to go into this I

2642
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,000
don't think we need to but I think they

2643
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,159
uh they can be grouped into two three

2644
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:38,159
categories uh the um first of all that

2645
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:41,199
our duty of care flows from the regime

2646
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:44,040
itself and the cbs's role in uh

2647
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:45,679
administering

2648
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:49,159
it uh second uh a duty of care would

2649
01:57:49,159 --> 01:57:51,440
flow from the treatment of other

2650
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,560
importers such as Sumit

2651
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:57,599
Tomo uh and then that duty of care would

2652
01:57:57,599 --> 01:57:59,840
flow also from specific representations

2653
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:02,639
that are alleged uh in the state in the

2654
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:05,719
amended statement of claim um

2655
01:58:05,719 --> 01:58:10,920
implicating a cbsa official um so in my

2656
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:13,480
uh submissions in the proximity analysis

2657
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:17,199
I will address those three uh sources of

2658
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:20,199
alleged sources of a duty of care and I

2659
01:58:20,199 --> 01:58:22,159
will argue that the nature the very

2660
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:24,880
nature and purpose of the custom Act and

2661
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:27,719
the custom regime uh runs contrary to

2662
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:30,400
the recognition of the duty of care

2663
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,239
second that the treatment of other

2664
01:58:32,239 --> 01:58:36,840
importer um in their is misguided and is

2665
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:39,320
Irrelevant in the and cannot ground a

2666
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,480
duty of care and third that the

2667
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:44,000
representations of the as alleged in the

2668
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,719
statement of claim of the cbsa official

2669
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:48,960
um cannot ground a duty of care in this

2670
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:52,159
case because uh they are insufficient

2671
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:55,599
insufficiently pleaded uh as they don't

2672
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:57,840
uh the plaintiff does not plead Reliance

2673
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:01,599
on those representation or nor uh

2674
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:04,679
causation so starting with how uh the

2675
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:07,360
nature of the regime runs contrary to uh

2676
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,719
the recognition of a proximity

2677
01:59:09,719 --> 01:59:14,119
relationship uh I think that for that uh

2678
01:59:14,119 --> 01:59:16,679
analysis we we definitely inevitably

2679
01:59:16,679 --> 01:59:19,199
have to start with what is the nature of

2680
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:22,239
the custom regime what what is uh what

2681
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:26,159
is its purpose and objective um I think

2682
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:29,440
this is key to uh the the duty of care

2683
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:33,040
analysis implicating A Public Authority

2684
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:37,480
so um we've we've the the the main

2685
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:39,679
purpose of the Customs act and my

2686
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:42,079
colleague Mr nasakin has touched on it

2687
01:59:42,079 --> 01:59:45,719
briefly um is to regulate oversee and

2688
01:59:45,719 --> 01:59:48,639
control crossb border movements of

2689
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:52,400
people and goods uh for the general

2690
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:55,560
welfare of the nation and you can find

2691
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:57,679
those statements in the the cases we

2692
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:02,079
cited in our in our factum of Martino

2693
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:05,679
versus Min Ministry of national revenue

2694
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:09,040
and Mitchell versus minister of national

2695
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:11,280
Revenue as well those are Supreme Court

2696
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:15,520
cases um in a Martino case another the

2697
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,880
Supreme Court also um said in other

2698
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:21,280
words that um the purpose of this the

2699
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:24,159
scheme of the the Customs schemes is one

2700
02:00:24,159 --> 02:00:28,040
of Taxation and economic

2701
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:30,239
regulation so I think that it's clear

2702
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:31,960
that from these cases and from the

2703
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:34,000
purpose of the scheme that there's a

2704
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:38,320
clear uh economic and public interest um

2705
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:41,840
uh purpose uh that is at the core of the

2706
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:45,719
regime um now the cbs's role in

2707
02:00:45,719 --> 02:00:49,159
administering and enforcing that regime

2708
02:00:49,159 --> 02:00:54,079
um is is important it it acts as a among

2709
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:57,760
other things as a duties collector uh on

2710
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,920
imported

2711
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:02,719
goods um and so one of the most

2712
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:06,480
important feature of this regime is uh

2713
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:08,719
self-reporting and this is very

2714
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:10,560
important and I want to insist on that

2715
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,560
because I think it's key when you're

2716
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:13,840
looking at the regime in the

2717
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:16,239
identification of a duty of care we have

2718
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:20,320
to have that in mind um so the the

2719
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:22,719
self-reporting nature of the regime is

2720
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:24,320
key to its

2721
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:27,440
Effectiveness um because uh the cbsa

2722
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:30,800
wouldn't be able to uh verify all the

2723
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:33,880
Declarations that uh that are that are

2724
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:36,159
submitted to it all the goods that are

2725
02:01:36,159 --> 02:01:39,360
imported um so that's why it is that's

2726
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:41,520
one of the reason why it is based on

2727
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:44,760
self-reporting which means that uh very

2728
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:47,719
bluntly it is based on the honesty of

2729
02:01:47,719 --> 02:01:50,239
importers when they import and declare

2730
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:53,320
their goods and it also uh is based on

2731
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:57,480
the accuracy um of the information uh

2732
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:01,119
that is contains It's contained in those

2733
02:02:01,119 --> 02:02:03,440
declarations

2734
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:06,159
um the I won't uh bring the court to

2735
02:02:06,159 --> 02:02:09,320
that specific uh portion but the case of

2736
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:13,679
rid V Canada uh 2020 from this court at

2737
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:15,400
tab

2738
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:20,000
45 at paragraph 35 and 36 set out a good

2739
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,800
um a good um summmer of what what I just

2740
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:25,440
told you justice

2741
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:31,079
gon um and so of course since it is uh

2742
02:02:31,079 --> 02:02:34,239
based on self uh reporting so self-

2743
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:36,599
compliance there's also mechanisms that

2744
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:38,840
are very important in the regime to

2745
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:42,520
ensure uh compliance and so the cbsa is

2746
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:45,360
Char

2747
02:02:45,719 --> 02:02:47,599
sorry

2748
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:50,520
here can you hear me Mr Mayor oh yeah

2749
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:53,079
you were uh cutting in out it was that

2750
02:02:53,079 --> 02:02:55,760
the case for me

2751
02:02:57,199 --> 02:02:59,199
too I don't know if it's my connection

2752
02:02:59,199 --> 02:03:02,199
or yours but

2753
02:03:03,639 --> 02:03:07,000
um um I can confirm that is your

2754
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,440
connection Justice

2755
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:15,639
gleon okay so I'm in my Chambers so

2756
02:03:15,639 --> 02:03:19,360
uh well it should be better now but I

2757
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:22,239
did see that it was uh getting wor first

2758
02:03:22,239 --> 02:03:26,239
a little bit seems to be back now Mr yes

2759
02:03:26,239 --> 02:03:29,000
okay Mr back did you miss anything there

2760
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,679
are you okay with where we are it was

2761
02:03:32,679 --> 02:03:34,360
cutting in and out for us as well

2762
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:36,719
justice gleon but I think I seized the

2763
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:39,400
general gist of where Mr Maher was going

2764
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:42,719
uh but certainly we I think we got the

2765
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:45,679
general GI good okay Mr mer go go ahead

2766
02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:46,800
I think we're I think we're back in

2767
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:49,079
business here again okay so if there's

2768
02:03:49,079 --> 02:03:52,199
any uh issue we can just migrate to uh

2769
02:03:52,199 --> 02:03:54,480
the telephone and I I can still use the

2770
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:57,679
camera so don't hesitate to uh to raise

2771
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:01,920
any concern yeah um yeah so I was just

2772
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,400
referring the court to the case of ridu

2773
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,559
which gives a a relevant and helpful uh

2774
02:04:08,559 --> 02:04:11,239
uh statements of the purpose of the

2775
02:04:11,239 --> 02:04:13,760
regime and the role of the cbsa in

2776
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:16,679
administering that regime I don't know

2777
02:04:16,679 --> 02:04:20,199
if you got that jce LE I do yes got that

2778
02:04:20,199 --> 02:04:22,960
okay so uh so I was about I was about to

2779
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:25,960
tell you about the compliance mechanism

2780
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:28,840
H and enfor and to enforce the regime

2781
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:32,079
that is based on self-reporting uh so

2782
02:04:32,079 --> 02:04:33,880
the regime as you know is comprised of

2783
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:37,480
several civil uh administrative and

2784
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:40,119
penal mechanisms to ensure that uh

2785
02:04:40,119 --> 02:04:42,320
importers and persons comply with the

2786
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:44,599
Customs Act and the regime and so this

2787
02:04:44,599 --> 02:04:48,320
is where verifications audits uh

2788
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:51,280
administrative monetary penalties uh and

2789
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:53,719
notice of penalty assessment come into

2790
02:04:53,719 --> 02:04:57,719
play um

2791
02:04:58,559 --> 02:05:01,280
so we like I told you at the from the

2792
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:03,920
outset uh we know that the courts have

2793
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:06,320
never opined at least to my knowledge on

2794
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,199
the existence of a duty of care between

2795
02:05:08,199 --> 02:05:11,840
cbsa and importers in that context um

2796
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:14,000
but they have opined many times on the

2797
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,159
relationship between uh tax Authority so

2798
02:05:17,159 --> 02:05:19,679
mainly the C and

2799
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:22,239
taxpayers specifically holding

2800
02:05:22,239 --> 02:05:24,360
in these cases that there can be no

2801
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:25,760
proximity

2802
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:28,520
relationship um between the tax

2803
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:32,040
collector the C and taxpayers facing an

2804
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:35,520
audit or a verification and this is a

2805
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:37,639
this has been a constant in all Canadian

2806
02:05:37,639 --> 02:05:40,520
jurisdiction including this court if

2807
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:43,440
you're uh I just refer you to paragraph

2808
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:50,079
for um 84 and 85 of our factum which uh

2809
02:05:50,079 --> 02:05:53,559
references um the most uh important

2810
02:05:53,559 --> 02:05:55,520
cases from different jurisdiction on

2811
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:59,599
that issue uh between the CRA and

2812
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:02,480
taxpayers um so we sub it it is our

2813
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:05,480
submission that the purpose uh and

2814
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:07,639
objectives of the custom Act and the

2815
02:06:07,639 --> 02:06:11,880
custom regime are akin to the tax regime

2816
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:13,960
and that the same rationale should apply

2817
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:15,400
that there can be no relationship

2818
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:18,840
between the cbsa and importers um at

2819
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:20,840
least not in the kind that is fleeted by

2820
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:23,280
the plaintiff before you today in the

2821
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:26,920
statement of claim um and to I'd like to

2822
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:29,040
spend some time into one of those cases

2823
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,480
since we're we're actually uh asking you

2824
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:35,840
to uh draw a an important comparison so

2825
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:39,199
if you could go um at tab 29 of our book

2826
02:06:39,199 --> 02:06:42,800
of authority this is the jco versus Her

2827
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:45,280
Majesty the queen in right of Canada

2828
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:48,280
case

2829
02:06:58,599 --> 02:07:02,599
at paragraph 26 sorry I I would like you

2830
02:07:02,599 --> 02:07:04,040
to

2831
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:07,000
go yes go ahead I have it yeah so I'll

2832
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,119
just go through a few uh a few of those

2833
02:07:10,119 --> 02:07:12,599
paragraphs not too many so please bear

2834
02:07:12,599 --> 02:07:14,679
with me but I think they're uh important

2835
02:07:14,679 --> 02:07:18,119
to uh to show you uh how the comparison

2836
02:07:18,119 --> 02:07:22,239
is indeed um very relevant uh so at

2837
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:24,840
paragraph 26 yeah um by the the court

2838
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:27,040
recogn it's the onario Superior Court by

2839
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:29,920
the way this is a 2021 case so pretty

2840
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:33,239
recent um the court recognized that a

2841
02:07:33,239 --> 02:07:36,800
duty of care has been uh has been has

2842
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:38,239
never been recognized and the courts

2843
02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:41,040
have refused to uh recognize one in the

2844
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:44,520
case of tax uh in the in the tax context

2845
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:46,079
it says that the claims for negligence

2846
02:07:46,079 --> 02:07:48,400
far no better there's emple case law

2847
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,040
rejecting the proximity required to

2848
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:53,159
formulate formulate a private law duty

2849
02:07:53,159 --> 02:07:55,400
of care between the C and taxpayer

2850
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:58,559
facing an audit uh and then at 28

2851
02:07:58,559 --> 02:08:01,119
there's a bit more uh meet to why uh

2852
02:08:01,119 --> 02:08:04,719
there can be no uh relation no proximity

2853
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:06,960
the court says the cases generally

2854
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:09,360
generally agree that the relationship of

2855
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:12,000
an auditor to a taxpayer while carrying

2856
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,480
out administrative duties in an audit is

2857
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:16,520
not the same as the relation the

2858
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:18,840
relationship between tax investigators

2859
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:21,920
who are investigating criminal offenses

2860
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:24,280
the cases hold that Auditors in an audit

2861
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:27,119
do not owe a private law duty of care to

2862
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:28,199
the

2863
02:08:28,199 --> 02:08:33,800
taxpayers uh at paragraph 33 so on two

2864
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:36,159
page

2865
02:08:37,239 --> 02:08:40,920
below let me know when you're there I am

2866
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:43,040
perfect so here the Ontario Superior

2867
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:45,719
Court cites with approval a case of the

2868
02:08:45,719 --> 02:08:48,360
Alberta uh court of appeal the granon

2869
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:50,719
case which is also included in our book

2870
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:54,760
of authority the court says uh citing

2871
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:58,040
paragraph 25 of that case in our view it

2872
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:00,239
is plain and obvious so it was a motion

2873
02:09:00,239 --> 02:09:02,880
to strike that an action in negligence

2874
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:05,280
cannot succeed it is clear that because

2875
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,920
of the inherently adverse relationship

2876
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:10,199
between Auditors who are exercising a

2877
02:09:10,199 --> 02:09:12,520
statutory function in taxpayers of

2878
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:15,119
finding a a sufficient proximity to

2879
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:17,920
ground a private law duty of of care

2880
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:21,800
does not exist and then the the final

2881
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:23,679
excerpt I want to take you to are at

2882
02:09:23,679 --> 02:09:26,760
paragraph 34 and

2883
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:30,480
35 of the jco

2884
02:09:30,480 --> 02:09:34,719
case uh in the middle of 34 starting

2885
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:38,400
with taxpayers and H HS collectors have

2886
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,880
resort to administrative processes in

2887
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:43,400
the courts to ensure that the taxmen is

2888
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:45,760
kept in check imposing negligence

2889
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:48,360
liability on top of that is inconsistent

2890
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:51,760
with the statutory scheme moreover it is

2891
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:54,360
hard if not impossible to discern

2892
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:56,000
anywhere in the relevant taxation

2893
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,920
statutes an implicit or implied private

2894
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:02,199
law duty of care owing by the C to

2895
02:10:02,199 --> 02:10:05,920
taxpayers and then at 35 also in the

2896
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:09,000
middle of the paragraph in my view

2897
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,239
imposing a super added private law duty

2898
02:10:11,239 --> 02:10:13,760
of Care on the CRA just imposes more

2899
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:15,520
costs on the government and gives

2900
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:18,239
taxpayers more procedural tools to defer

2901
02:10:18,239 --> 02:10:21,360
tax unlike police officer investigating

2902
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,440
a crime and I take it this is a

2903
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:26,480
reference to the hill case of the

2904
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:29,400
Supreme Court there are already thorough

2905
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,679
and comprehensive regulatory schemes to

2906
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:37,480
ensure that the C obeys the rules so um

2907
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:40,239
we think that uh the same rationale

2908
02:10:40,239 --> 02:10:43,440
should apply with the cbsa in this case

2909
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:46,520
that was acting as a a some an auditor

2910
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:48,960
someone verifying the Importer and also

2911
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:51,320
as a duty collectors in assessing the

2912
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:54,840
duties owing and imposing um the

2913
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:57,719
duties uh one another case that I want

2914
02:10:57,719 --> 02:11:01,440
to take you to which uh further uh would

2915
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:02,880
support that

2916
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:06,239
comparison is the case from this court

2917
02:11:06,239 --> 02:11:09,880
uh is the case of salesman V Canada at

2918
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:13,800
tab uh 46 so it's volume two of our book

2919
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:15,920
of

2920
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,320
authority and so I think it's uh this

2921
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:23,040
case is also highly relevant by first

2922
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:26,360
because it's one uh from this court it

2923
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:29,000
was rendered by uh justice Leah who was

2924
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,320
at the federal court at the time and uh

2925
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:34,639
although the the factual issues in that

2926
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:38,000
case are not really similar to um the

2927
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,480
ones that are before you there's a

2928
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:42,000
paragraph um

2929
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,630
41 that I want to take you to

2930
02:11:45,630 --> 02:11:54,480
[Laughter]

2931
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:59,639
and I and it it it draws a bit on how um

2932
02:11:59,639 --> 02:12:01,920
it explains uh I think in a wellp put

2933
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:04,960
manner what what why can there be no

2934
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:08,079
relationship between the C and taxpayers

2935
02:12:08,079 --> 02:12:10,920
so uh justice Lan States unlike

2936
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:13,199
financial institutions the C is not a

2937
02:12:13,199 --> 02:12:15,520
commercial undertaking offering its

2938
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:17,840
products and services in an open

2939
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:20,760
competitive market the CRA is a creature

2940
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:22,880
of stat statute was man whose mandate is

2941
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:25,119
to administer an income tax system that

2942
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:27,880
relies on self-reporting by taxpayers

2943
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:30,000
and to that end the ACT gives the CRA

2944
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,400
broad powers in supervising the scheme

2945
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,920
of assessing and auditing

2946
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:37,559
taxpayers in such context the CRA and

2947
02:12:37,559 --> 02:12:39,559
taxpayers have opposing interest their

2948
02:12:39,559 --> 02:12:41,360
relationship is therefore not one where

2949
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:43,480
the CRA should be responsible for

2950
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:46,199
protecting taxpayers from losses arising

2951
02:12:46,199 --> 02:12:49,639
from their assessment rather it is one

2952
02:12:49,639 --> 02:12:51,760
it is that of debtor creditor

2953
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:54,040
governed by Statute and in a sense

2954
02:12:54,040 --> 02:12:56,840
adverse as a result absent absent a

2955
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:59,000
breach of the powers in the act the C

2956
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,800
has no Duty towards taxpayers other than

2957
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:04,119
to act in accordance with the act for

2958
02:13:04,119 --> 02:13:08,040
the purposes of the act

2959
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:11,040
so we submit that the same rationale

2960
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:14,079
should apply in this case between the C

2961
02:13:14,079 --> 02:13:14,960
and the

2962
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:19,280
plaintiff um and because both both

2963
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:22,000
regimes are strikingly similar and if

2964
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:25,079
you uh if I if I may Justice Lon I just

2965
02:13:25,079 --> 02:13:28,760
want to take you through some uh some uh

2966
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:32,079
features of the custom act regime and

2967
02:13:32,079 --> 02:13:34,599
show how and show to you uh hopefully

2968
02:13:34,599 --> 02:13:36,800
that that it's very similar in some ways

2969
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:39,520
to uh the tax regime

2970
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:43,559
okay um so I think both uh regime

2971
02:13:43,559 --> 02:13:46,880
involve the state or an agency as a

2972
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:51,119
money collector the cbsa VR duties um

2973
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:54,960
and the the C via taxes or uh or

2974
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:58,000
else uh both regime also rely on the

2975
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,880
same founding principle of

2976
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:01,320
self-reporting

2977
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:04,559
uh and on you know accuracy and honesty

2978
02:14:04,559 --> 02:14:07,639
of importers or

2979
02:14:07,639 --> 02:14:12,440
taxpayers um and so you can find uh

2980
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:15,480
traces of that core principle in the

2981
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:19,199
scheme itself in the Customs act uh at

2982
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:21,880
section 7.1

2983
02:14:21,880 --> 02:14:23,840
uh it sets out the obligation for

2984
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:25,480
importers such as the plaintiff to

2985
02:14:25,480 --> 02:14:28,480
provide accurate complete information on

2986
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:29,960
the goods they

2987
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:34,040
import um section 12 of the Customs act

2988
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:36,440
sets out the obligation to report the

2989
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:38,159
goods they

2990
02:14:38,159 --> 02:14:42,760
import um also section 32 of the custom

2991
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:46,599
act uh sets out uh that the importers

2992
02:14:46,599 --> 02:14:49,280
themselves have to account for the goods

2993
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:51,679
they import they have to declare their

2994
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:54,800
value for Duty uh declare their tariff

2995
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:58,079
classification and pay the required

2996
02:14:58,079 --> 02:15:00,440
duties uh section

2997
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:04,320
32.2 which is of interest in this case

2998
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:08,480
today uh uh states that importers must

2999
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:11,320
by themselves correct their declaration

3000
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:13,800
if they have reason to believe that

3001
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:17,079
their uh declarations were Incorrect and

3002
02:15:17,079 --> 02:15:18,679
that obligation as you know ends four

3003
02:15:18,679 --> 02:15:21,280
years after the goods are accounted for

3004
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:24,199
so this is just uh examples where that

3005
02:15:24,199 --> 02:15:25,639
self-reporting

3006
02:15:25,639 --> 02:15:28,440
principle uh can be found practically in

3007
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:29,440
the

3008
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:31,559
regime um and

3009
02:15:31,559 --> 02:15:34,199
so both regime both the tax and the

3010
02:15:34,199 --> 02:15:38,599
custom regimes um involves uh gives

3011
02:15:38,599 --> 02:15:42,840
brand BR grants broad powers on um to

3012
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:45,639
conduct Audits and conduct

3013
02:15:45,639 --> 02:15:48,639
verification uh section

3014
02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:51,920
42 and section 42

3015
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:55,679
.01 in the Customs Act is this is where

3016
02:15:55,679 --> 02:15:59,079
you can find uh this it grants the power

3017
02:15:59,079 --> 02:16:01,920
to the cbsa to conduct random Audits and

3018
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:04,480
verification to ensure compliance with

3019
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:05,400
the

3020
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:10,159
ACT um and of course both both the tax

3021
02:16:10,159 --> 02:16:13,000
in the custom regime uh to protect

3022
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,880
importers and individuals and companies

3023
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:18,960
from uh incorrect decisions uh both

3024
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:21,119
include a multi-level

3025
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:23,480
uh appeal scheme that ultimately

3026
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:26,119
culminate in a special administrative

3027
02:16:26,119 --> 02:16:29,159
tribunal and uh potentially to uh the

3028
02:16:29,159 --> 02:16:30,960
federal court of

3029
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:34,479
appeal so uh so there so this this is

3030
02:16:34,479 --> 02:16:36,519
why we say they're strikingly similar

3031
02:16:36,519 --> 02:16:39,319
and I and we submit that the rationale

3032
02:16:39,319 --> 02:16:42,000
that has been developed by the courts on

3033
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,719
the absence of a duty of care between

3034
02:16:43,719 --> 02:16:47,679
the CRA and taxpayers should apply um

3035
02:16:47,679 --> 02:16:51,719
almost uh mutatis mutandis to the cbsa

3036
02:16:51,719 --> 02:16:54,359
and importers uh in this and the

3037
02:16:54,359 --> 02:16:57,920
plaintiff in this case

3038
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:02,319
um we submit that absent a claim of bad

3039
02:17:02,319 --> 02:17:06,240
fate or misfeasance in in um public

3040
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:09,120
office the cbsa cannot be held in

3041
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,479
negligence by simply carrying out its

3042
02:17:11,479 --> 02:17:15,240
duties of uh verifying some importers

3043
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:18,880
imposing duties and then collect those

3044
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:21,800
duties um and so they both have they

3045
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:24,679
both have at their core a relationship

3046
02:17:24,679 --> 02:17:27,479
of uh that is one of deor creditor

3047
02:17:27,479 --> 02:17:31,479
importers being uh the the deor um most

3048
02:17:31,479 --> 02:17:37,080
often of um of uh duties to the state in

3049
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:39,359
the per in the person of the

3050
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:43,599
cbsa um so in with that in mind with the

3051
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:46,399
purpose of the Customs Act and the

3052
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:48,960
what's been said on the tax regime we

3053
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:51,000
submit that it would not be fair just

3054
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:55,120
and reasonable to impose a duty of care

3055
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:58,599
um on Auditors and officers of the cbsa

3056
02:17:58,599 --> 02:18:01,040
charged with the ad the administration

3057
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:03,519
of the Customs regime and the collection

3058
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:04,240
of

3059
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:07,920
Duties so is it your position that that

3060
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:10,479
a duty of care given the statutory

3061
02:18:10,479 --> 02:18:14,200
regime um you you just stated that

3062
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:16,639
absent bad faith or misfeasance no Duty

3063
02:18:16,639 --> 02:18:19,599
would attach um are those the only two

3064
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:21,319
circumstances uh I think we're going to

3065
02:18:21,319 --> 02:18:23,559
talk a little bit here uh about the

3066
02:18:23,559 --> 02:18:26,160
whole issue of representations as well

3067
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:29,319
um do representations attract to duty I

3068
02:18:29,319 --> 02:18:30,399
know you're going to argue that it's not

3069
02:18:30,399 --> 02:18:32,880
properly pled but does does that fall

3070
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:35,399
within your bad faith or mis deance

3071
02:18:35,399 --> 02:18:38,000
category or is there is is it a broader

3072
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,679
category of circumstances where a duty

3073
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:41,920
might

3074
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:44,280
attach

3075
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:47,399
um okay I just let me know if I don't

3076
02:18:47,399 --> 02:18:49,559
understand your question but um yeah so

3077
02:18:49,559 --> 02:18:51,359
we take that in this case in the

3078
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:53,679
circumstances of this case they cannot

3079
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:55,080
ground the duty of care the

3080
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:57,000
representations of the

3081
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:01,880
cbsa um I think the case law says that

3082
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:06,200
uh in um in negligence claim involving

3083
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:10,000
public authorities um interactions may

3084
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,359
involve uh the recognition of a duty of

3085
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:16,760
care so our position is not would not

3086
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:19,319
would not uh be contrary to that that

3087
02:19:19,319 --> 02:19:22,160
well accepted principle

3088
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:26,319
um but I think so I I'm reticent a bit

3089
02:19:26,319 --> 02:19:29,920
to to answer any hypothetical uh set of

3090
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:32,399
facts that might uh where

3091
02:19:32,399 --> 02:19:34,800
representations and undertakings might

3092
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:37,479
come into play but I I think we in the

3093
02:19:37,479 --> 02:19:39,559
in the case of uh and I'll speak a bit

3094
02:19:39,559 --> 02:19:41,559
to that more generally when I get to

3095
02:19:41,559 --> 02:19:45,519
that point but um I think that um you

3096
02:19:45,519 --> 02:19:47,479
know some representations made by a

3097
02:19:47,479 --> 02:19:49,319
public official or by by Public

3098
02:19:49,319 --> 02:19:53,200
Authority uh can cannot uh cannot

3099
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:58,479
um have the effect of uh of um of uh you

3100
02:19:58,479 --> 02:20:01,160
know neutralizing the effect of Express

3101
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:04,200
legislative Authority or uh go contrary

3102
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:08,920
to uh to uh legislative Provisions so

3103
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:10,760
and so so I think that does answer my

3104
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:14,359
question okay your bad faith misfeasance

3105
02:20:14,359 --> 02:20:16,840
category might be might be broader but

3106
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:19,439
it's it's it's and again I'm not asking

3107
02:20:19,439 --> 02:20:22,640
you to define the breadth of that

3108
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:24,840
whether or not this is the only category

3109
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:27,399
of circumstances yeah yeah it appears

3110
02:20:27,399 --> 02:20:29,200
that's not the case it appears that

3111
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:31,080
you're suggesting it could be broader

3112
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:32,760
without taking a position with respect

3113
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:35,040
to where we are here yeah and I think

3114
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:37,200
maybe I can explain a bit further my

3115
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:40,240
point in raising those other uh causes

3116
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:42,160
of Damages I think it's to just show

3117
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,040
that in the case of public claw

3118
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:46,600
authorities often and that's what we've

3119
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:48,560
seen in the case law you will need

3120
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:51,479
something more than just negligence um

3121
02:20:51,479 --> 02:20:55,319
to uh engage uh civil liability so

3122
02:20:55,319 --> 02:20:58,640
that's why I raised um bad faith or

3123
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:01,399
misfeasance in public office where I

3124
02:21:01,399 --> 02:21:03,840
think arguably we can accept the fact

3125
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:06,439
that it would be uh it would if the

3126
02:21:06,439 --> 02:21:08,399
facts are properly pleaded depending on

3127
02:21:08,399 --> 02:21:10,200
what they are it would be harder for

3128
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:12,920
Public Authority to uh strike a claim at

3129
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:14,040
this

3130
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:17,200
stage thank

3131
02:21:17,439 --> 02:21:20,040
you so this was my first point on the

3132
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:21,120
proximity

3133
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:23,920
analysis uh then I want to address the

3134
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:26,520
uh alleged treatment of other importers

3135
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,200
in this case and specifically uh this

3136
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:33,240
the Sumit Tomo and how um that cannot

3137
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:36,479
ground the duty of care in this case so

3138
02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:38,080
uh

3139
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:40,720
sorry so the the plaintiff just to sum

3140
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:43,240
up I think how I I how we view the claim

3141
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:45,200
of the plaintiff they claim that the

3142
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:48,240
cdsa allowed and I'm quoting their uh

3143
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:51,120
wording allowed other importers to

3144
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,399
import similar Goods or identical Goods

3145
02:21:53,399 --> 02:21:55,600
under tariff number

3146
02:21:55,600 --> 02:22:00,040
21 uh and that in particular Sumit Tomo

3147
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:03,840
uh they also raised uh the their they

3148
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:05,359
were treated differently so they

3149
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:07,800
differential treatment as to the the

3150
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:10,600
other importers in the

3151
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:14,640
industry um they also claimed that

3152
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:18,439
um basically that cbsa targeted them by

3153
02:22:18,439 --> 02:22:21,000
only verifying them and not the other

3154
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:24,200
importers and by only imposing duties

3155
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:27,399
and retroactive duties on them and that

3156
02:22:27,399 --> 02:22:30,200
uh engages uh a duty of care and that

3157
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:34,960
engages uh the liability of the cbsa in

3158
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:37,680
negligence uh and you can find those

3159
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:41,479
just for your reference at paragraph uh

3160
02:22:41,479 --> 02:22:46,120
38 to to 44 of their amended statement

3161
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:48,479
of claim this is all set out clearly

3162
02:22:48,479 --> 02:22:52,560
there and also paragraph 4 49 and 52 of

3163
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:55,680
their amended statement of

3164
02:22:55,960 --> 02:22:58,600
claim now in their amended statement of

3165
02:22:58,600 --> 02:23:01,160
claim there's some overlap also between

3166
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:03,359
the negligence claim and the breach of

3167
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:07,720
public law Duty claim so um sometimes uh

3168
02:23:07,720 --> 02:23:09,880
it can be a bit confusing but I think it

3169
02:23:09,880 --> 02:23:12,960
was set out clearly in their memorandum

3170
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:15,560
how they see that that that sort how

3171
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:18,760
they plead that source of Duty of care

3172
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:22,439
in paragraph 40 eight of their factum

3173
02:23:22,439 --> 02:23:24,880
for your

3174
02:23:29,319 --> 02:23:31,600
reference

3175
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:35,080
so this source of a duty of care as

3176
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:38,080
pleaded uh we submit that it's misguided

3177
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:39,960
and it shows a fundamental

3178
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:42,640
misunderstanding of the Customs

3179
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:44,960
regime uh and I want to address two

3180
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:47,560
points on that before I move on to the

3181
02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:51,640
ca specific case of sumito

3182
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:56,920
and do do you need a moment or go go

3183
02:23:56,920 --> 02:24:00,840
ahead so uh first the cvsa does not

3184
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:04,160
allow uh importers to import Goods on C

3185
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:06,240
under a certain tariff

3186
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:09,600
item uh and as I've mentioned earlier

3187
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:10,920
this is because it's based on a

3188
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,080
self-reporting

3189
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:15,279
principle so the burden actually lies on

3190
02:24:15,279 --> 02:24:18,319
importers to honestly and accurately uh

3191
02:24:18,319 --> 02:24:21,200
report and declare their goods

3192
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:22,800
and not the other way around it it's not

3193
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:25,080
cbsa that we look at every declarations

3194
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:27,880
and that say yes you can you can import

3195
02:24:27,880 --> 02:24:31,000
those uh so so practically it's

3196
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,399
inaccurate to ground a duty of Care on

3197
02:24:33,399 --> 02:24:36,080
the understanding that the cbsa allowed

3198
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:39,479
other importers to um import similar

3199
02:24:39,479 --> 02:24:42,319
Goods the cbsa in this case

3200
02:24:42,319 --> 02:24:47,120
only only can verify a a a sub a portion

3201
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:49,800
of all the importers in Canada and

3202
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:53,479
verify them and imposed uh the duties uh

3203
02:24:53,479 --> 02:24:57,800
that the cbsa um thinks are appropriate

3204
02:24:57,800 --> 02:25:00,960
so the cbsa cannot be held liable for

3205
02:25:00,960 --> 02:25:03,760
what the other importers declared over

3206
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:04,720
the

3207
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:09,120
years um and again to illustrate that

3208
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:13,279
how the burden uh rely the burden falls

3209
02:25:13,279 --> 02:25:15,800
on importers I'm just quoting from the

3210
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:19,200
case of ridu at tab 45 that I uh you

3211
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:22,800
don't need to go that I've uh raised uh

3212
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:25,640
earlier um the court there says at

3213
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:29,040
paragraph 36 the obligation to provide

3214
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:31,520
full accurate and complete information

3215
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:34,680
imposes a heavy burden on an individual

3216
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:37,120
or an importer a burden that is not

3217
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:40,359
displaced by forgetfulness or good

3218
02:25:40,359 --> 02:25:43,560
faith so that's my first point on that

3219
02:25:43,560 --> 02:25:47,080
second Point um does does the existence

3220
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:52,680
of the um of the uh of the ruling that

3221
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:54,200
that was being relied upon here does

3222
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:55,200
that

3223
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:57,279
change

3224
02:25:57,279 --> 02:26:00,880
so no we don't think so and I have a I

3225
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:04,000
have a my not I have many submissions to

3226
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:08,080
make on that but um I I will I will get

3227
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:11,920
to it in a in a minute or so thank you

3228
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:13,720
here I just want to make two more

3229
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:16,120
General point on you know the

3230
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:18,359
differential treatment an importer uh

3231
02:26:18,359 --> 02:26:20,399
would get by being verified and not

3232
02:26:20,399 --> 02:26:23,319
other importer and then I will address

3233
02:26:23,319 --> 02:26:25,399
the specific circumstances of this case

3234
02:26:25,399 --> 02:26:28,479
in Sumit Tomo

3235
02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:31,479
specifically

3236
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:38,439
pardon well

3237
02:26:38,439 --> 02:26:41,920
second uh the these allegations cannot

3238
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:43,680
ground a duty of care because this the

3239
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:47,960
Customs act does not require the cbsa to

3240
02:26:47,960 --> 02:26:52,840
uh the cbsa can verify uh any importers

3241
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:56,040
as it sees fit within the powers and

3242
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:58,200
constraints of the statute and the

3243
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:01,920
regime that's for sure uh but uh the

3244
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:05,080
power the discretion to uh conduct

3245
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:10,279
verification is uh is uh falls on cbsa

3246
02:27:10,279 --> 02:27:11,920
uh shoulder and it's part of its

3247
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:14,880
statutory powers and duties uh and I've

3248
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:16,439
mentioned that

3249
02:27:16,439 --> 02:27:19,520
uh that provision but it's found mainly

3250
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:20,720
at uh

3251
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:23,040
section

3252
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:26,359
42.1 the power to verify and audit

3253
02:27:26,359 --> 02:27:30,200
importers uh so the C this Customs act

3254
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:34,200
does not require the cbsa to audit every

3255
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:36,160
importer in a given

3256
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:39,000
industry uh out of fairness or else

3257
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:42,680
towards that industry or towards those

3258
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:45,920
importers uh and it certainly does not

3259
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:50,200
uh imposes the duty uh on the cbsa to

3260
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:54,120
impos duties on every player in a given

3261
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:58,160
industry and I I think it's fair to say

3262
02:27:58,160 --> 02:27:59,560
that it would be

3263
02:27:59,560 --> 02:28:02,479
impossible uh and and and it would take

3264
02:28:02,479 --> 02:28:05,399
an enormous amount of resources to audit

3265
02:28:05,399 --> 02:28:08,240
every importer in a given

3266
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:10,040
industry

3267
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:13,560
um one could also argue that it would be

3268
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:16,520
very uh An Inconvenient and I would say

3269
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:20,240
impossible for the cbsa to try to assess

3270
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:22,600
what is a given what is an

3271
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:24,840
industry

3272
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:27,800
um and but more importantly I think it's

3273
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:30,560
impossible to ask of the

3274
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:34,000
cbsa and it's not required in the regime

3275
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,200
that they try to assess the potential

3276
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:37,359
impact of

3277
02:28:37,359 --> 02:28:40,359
Duties on one importer and let alone

3278
02:28:40,359 --> 02:28:42,600
assess how auditing and collecting

3279
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:46,200
duties on uh one player could affect an

3280
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:48,800
industry at large because this is what

3281
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:51,479
the plaintiff is arguing is at the basis

3282
02:28:51,479 --> 02:28:55,240
of the duty of care um that the the cbsa

3283
02:28:55,240 --> 02:28:57,920
knew that it would have an effect on the

3284
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:00,240
competitive landscape and I'm quoting

3285
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:05,240
them of the industry and so on so like I

3286
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:08,600
said this the I we submit that the

3287
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:11,760
Customs act does not require this but

3288
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:14,840
more uh importantly or more forcefully

3289
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:18,279
uh it would Rend um it runs contrary to

3290
02:29:18,279 --> 02:29:20,120
its fundamental principle of

3291
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:22,200
self-reporting that I've uh talked to

3292
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:25,040
you about um already and it would in

3293
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:27,479
effect render the whole regime

3294
02:29:27,479 --> 02:29:29,840
unmanageable this is our

3295
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:33,120
submission uh and just as a reference

3296
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:36,399
for your reference the case of RV

3297
02:29:36,399 --> 02:29:40,760
top uh on ter superior court at tab 44

3298
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:42,920
of our book of

3299
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:45,720
authorities uh touches very briefly but

3300
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:48,920
touches on uh the reality of the

3301
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:51,880
cbsa uh uh and the fact that uh

3302
02:29:51,880 --> 02:29:55,520
thousands and uh hundreds of thousands

3303
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:58,760
of transactions and importations occur

3304
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:02,640
every day and that the cbsa uh relies on

3305
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:05,399
on the honesty and accuracy of importers

3306
02:30:05,399 --> 02:30:08,359
it cannot be uh it cannot look at all of

3307
02:30:08,359 --> 02:30:10,560
the what crosses the

3308
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:13,640
border so and this is found at paragraph

3309
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:15,439
five just for your

3310
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:19,680
reference thank you

3311
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:22,960
so we submit just I want to use some

3312
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:25,920
analogies here we submit that the C the

3313
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:28,080
CB uh the plaintiff's position in that

3314
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:30,479
regard that a duty of care would flow

3315
02:30:30,479 --> 02:30:33,279
from the treatment of other importers in

3316
02:30:33,279 --> 02:30:35,080
general

3317
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:39,680
um that um it's like saying a taxpayer

3318
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:42,160
that was assessed and imposed tax should

3319
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:45,000
not have to pay his taxes because other

3320
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,120
people were using the same scheme or

3321
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:50,080
doing the same thing and were not cut to

3322
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:53,000
use an even more simple analogy I think

3323
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,520
their position also amounts to say that

3324
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:58,040
uh someone was caught speeding on the

3325
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:01,720
highway uh was imposed a fin and because

3326
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:03,479
and that person would say because other

3327
02:31:03,479 --> 02:31:06,359
people were speeding that uh the state

3328
02:31:06,359 --> 02:31:10,960
shouldn't impose a fine on them

3329
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:15,479
um so in this case the cbsa even if we

3330
02:31:15,479 --> 02:31:17,960
take we take the the pleadings and the

3331
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:21,520
facts as pleaded uh the cbsa was just

3332
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:25,520
doing its job select one importer for a

3333
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:28,240
verification conduct a

3334
02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:31,359
verification um determine tariff

3335
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:34,720
classification uh and then determine uh

3336
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:36,399
what are the duties

3337
02:31:36,399 --> 02:31:39,720
owing and then collect these duties uh

3338
02:31:39,720 --> 02:31:42,720
in line all in line with its statutory

3339
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:45,840
duties so now I want to a few words on

3340
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:47,160
the Sumit

3341
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:51,720
too uh circumstance of this case

3342
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:54,399
so uh apart from those general for

3343
02:31:54,399 --> 02:31:57,399
relying on those General uh sources of

3344
02:31:57,399 --> 02:32:00,319
Duty treatment of importers at large the

3345
02:32:00,319 --> 02:32:02,160
the plaintiff relies on the specific

3346
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:05,160
treatment of

3347
02:32:05,319 --> 02:32:08,240
Sumitomo um claiming that the cvsa

3348
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:11,880
allowed Sumitomo to import uh similar or

3349
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:15,000
identical Goods without uh Duty and

3350
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:18,120
without imposing a penalty until the

3351
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:22,000
Advent ruling of uh 20 5 was

3352
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,560
rescinded and you can find mention of

3353
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:27,279
that and that they also claim that that

3354
02:32:27,279 --> 02:32:29,640
grounds a duty of care in this

3355
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:33,560
case pardon you can find mention of uh

3356
02:32:33,560 --> 02:32:36,520
that fact and that those circumstances

3357
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:38,880
in the amended statement of claim at

3358
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:40,520
paragraph

3359
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:44,160
8 40

3360
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:47,800
41

3361
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:51,240
44 49

3362
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:53,520
and

3363
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:57,000
52 so

3364
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,399
sumos different

3365
02:32:59,399 --> 02:33:02,560
situation uh we don't deny it at all but

3366
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:05,399
it's simply the effect of legislation in

3367
02:33:05,399 --> 02:33:07,760
this case it is not a so-called

3368
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:10,520
favorable treatment by the cbsa to

3369
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:13,920
Sumitomo or a granting of a to quote the

3370
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:15,319
plaintiff at the granting of an

3371
02:33:15,319 --> 02:33:18,080
exemption window to Sumit

3372
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:20,279
Tomo uh in fact

3373
02:33:20,279 --> 02:33:23,560
in this case Sumit Tomo was wise enough

3374
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:27,240
to Avail itself of an advance ruling and

3375
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:30,200
all of its benefits that are contained

3376
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:33,359
and that flow from the legislation

3377
02:33:33,359 --> 02:33:35,840
itself in this case the Tariff

3378
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:40,279
classification Advance ruling

3379
02:33:41,399 --> 02:33:43,279
regulations

3380
02:33:43,279 --> 02:33:47,680
so what I don't know if you're uh U if

3381
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:49,840
you knew about the the Advent ruling and

3382
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:52,279
that regulations but in a sense a

3383
02:33:52,279 --> 02:33:54,920
company can ask the cbsa they can

3384
02:33:54,920 --> 02:33:57,000
pertain to different issues but they can

3385
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:58,800
pertain to tariff

3386
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:01,240
classification an importer can ask the

3387
02:34:01,240 --> 02:34:04,319
cbsa uh before you know before uh going

3388
02:34:04,319 --> 02:34:07,359
through the whole appeal scheme can ask

3389
02:34:07,359 --> 02:34:10,399
the cbsa to give their um what they

3390
02:34:10,399 --> 02:34:13,000
think of the goods would be classified

3391
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,560
under what tarfi them and then the

3392
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:17,640
Importer gets the advance ruling and it

3393
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:20,640
can rely on it to import

3394
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:22,359
um its

3395
02:34:22,359 --> 02:34:26,520
goods and so that's what sum Tomo did uh

3396
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:29,760
the advance ruling of 2005 confirmed

3397
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:31,319
about that the goods in issue could be

3398
02:34:31,319 --> 02:34:35,000
imported under tariff item 21 for a

3399
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:38,439
number of years and so the cbsa uh

3400
02:34:38,439 --> 02:34:42,120
conducted its verification uh into um

3401
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:45,560
the plaintiff's importation and it

3402
02:34:45,560 --> 02:34:48,880
basically at the same time or after the

3403
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:53,080
verification uh the cbsa also rescinded

3404
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:55,720
the uh Advance ruling uh that was issued

3405
02:34:55,720 --> 02:35:00,040
to Sumit Tomo so so

3406
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:02,960
um yeah so and

3407
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:05,760
then does the regulation have it say

3408
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:08,840
anything with respect to the ability of

3409
02:35:08,840 --> 02:35:11,160
another uh party to come forward and ask

3410
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:12,920
for an advanced ruling on the same issue

3411
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:15,120
once once's an advance rul has been been

3412
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:16,720
granted does the regulation deal with

3413
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:18,960
that in other words could every every

3414
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:22,040
competitor in this in the industry that

3415
02:35:22,040 --> 02:35:24,840
was importing this particular item do

3416
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:26,960
the regulations allow them all to

3417
02:35:26,960 --> 02:35:28,479
individually come forward and obtain an

3418
02:35:28,479 --> 02:35:30,760
advanced ruling or once a ruling is

3419
02:35:30,760 --> 02:35:32,800
issued is it uh is it something that

3420
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:37,600
applies to all yeah reconsider the issue

3421
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:40,279
yeah and I think uh it might be useful

3422
02:35:40,279 --> 02:35:42,800
for us to go into the regulations but an

3423
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:45,840
advance ruling only applies to between

3424
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:48,399
it's only binding between the minister

3425
02:35:48,399 --> 02:35:51,319
and the recipient of the advance ruling

3426
02:35:51,319 --> 02:35:53,319
okay and this flows from the

3427
02:35:53,319 --> 02:35:56,920
legislation um I can if you can uh take

3428
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:59,800
tab six of our book of authority I'll

3429
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:02,120
walk you through the main features of

3430
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:04,840
the the

3431
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:10,359
regime yes I have

3432
02:36:10,479 --> 02:36:14,600
it um yeah hold

3433
02:36:15,439 --> 02:36:20,240
on I'll just find mine

3434
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:31,680
open up my electronic version

3435
02:36:33,439 --> 02:36:36,439
sorry so in this case yeah the cbsa

3436
02:36:36,439 --> 02:36:38,560
rescinded Sumit Tomo Advance ruling

3437
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:41,439
precisely because it was now of the view

3438
02:36:41,439 --> 02:36:44,640
that um tariff item 21 uh was not

3439
02:36:44,640 --> 02:36:47,160
applicable to the the type of goods that

3440
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:51,680
are in issue today so uh if you take um

3441
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:57,279
Section 8 this is where

3442
02:36:57,279 --> 02:37:00,120
uh it says an advance ruling applies to

3443
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:01,800
Goods that are the subject of the

3444
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:03,760
advance ruling and are imported on or

3445
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:05,840
after the effective date of the Advan

3446
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:08,840
ruling so we submit that this means that

3447
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:11,160
the advance ruling only applies to the

3448
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:14,000
specific Goods uh imported by the

3449
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,120
recipient of the the Advent

3450
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:20,800
ruling uh and this is further evidence

3451
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:22,600
in section

3452
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:27,120
10 which states that an advent ruling is

3453
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:29,720
uh binding or remain in effect and shall

3454
02:37:29,720 --> 02:37:30,800
bind a

3455
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:35,560
minister H and be the person to whom the

3456
02:37:35,560 --> 02:37:37,720
advance ruling was given has acted in

3457
02:37:37,720 --> 02:37:40,279
accordance with the

3458
02:37:40,279 --> 02:37:46,439
ruling um and then this section uh 13

3459
02:37:46,439 --> 02:37:49,520
explains the uh the so-called

3460
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:52,200
differential treatment of

3461
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:55,960
Sumitomo if you go to section um so

3462
02:37:55,960 --> 02:37:58,960
section uh 12 gives the gr gives the

3463
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:03,160
power to the cbsa or an officer to uh

3464
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:06,279
modify or revoke an advance ruling and

3465
02:38:06,279 --> 02:38:09,520
so section 30 13 deals with the effect

3466
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:12,479
of that and this is what happened in the

3467
02:38:12,479 --> 02:38:16,600
Sumitomo case subject to subsection two

3468
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:18,880
uh a modification or revocation of an

3469
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:21,359
advaned rule applies to Goods that are

3470
02:38:21,359 --> 02:38:24,040
the subject of the Advent ruling and are

3471
02:38:24,040 --> 02:38:27,640
imported on or after the effective date

3472
02:38:27,640 --> 02:38:30,120
of the modification or

3473
02:38:30,120 --> 02:38:32,520
revocation so that's

3474
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:35,800
why because of the legislation when the

3475
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:39,160
advance ruling was changed uh or revoked

3476
02:38:39,160 --> 02:38:44,200
to Sumit Tomo uh the cbsa could only uh

3477
02:38:44,200 --> 02:38:47,800
ask from Sumit Tomo to pay the duties

3478
02:38:47,800 --> 02:38:51,120
from the DAT of modification and go

3479
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:54,359
on and that so so my question though was

3480
02:38:54,359 --> 02:38:57,600
was more specific than that and that

3481
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:02,319
is was do the regulations

3482
02:39:02,319 --> 02:39:04,880
contemplate different parties coming

3483
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:06,399
forward and asking for an advanced

3484
02:39:06,399 --> 02:39:09,040
ruling with respect to the very same

3485
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:11,640
items so in other words Sumitomo

3486
02:39:11,640 --> 02:39:13,040
received an advanced ruling on the

3487
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:16,000
import of Wheels

3488
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,960
yeah yeah the having having that have

3489
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,080
and and

3490
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:22,200
from the plaintiff

3491
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:24,040
submissions uh the effect of that

3492
02:39:24,040 --> 02:39:26,040
advanced ruling or the results of that

3493
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:27,760
advanced ruling are are made available

3494
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:30,160
to other importers

3495
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:33,880
other to access and see those Advanced

3496
02:39:33,880 --> 02:39:37,720
rulings and my question is is does

3497
02:39:37,720 --> 02:39:40,080
anything in the regulatory scheme pre

3498
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:41,760
would have prevented Ronco in this

3499
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:44,000
particular circumstance from seeking

3500
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,600
Advanced ruling with respect to the very

3501
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:50,160
same item yeah so I I just so I just

3502
02:39:50,160 --> 02:39:53,200
want to be clear uh just uh clarify some

3503
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:55,600
facts that you just stated if you look

3504
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:57,920
at the what's pleaded in their amended

3505
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:01,000
statement of claim they they pled that

3506
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:04,600
um the plaintiff pleds that uh some the

3507
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:06,880
some some Advance rulings are made

3508
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:09,439
available to the public so they don't

3509
02:40:09,439 --> 02:40:11,560
plead that this Advance ruling was made

3510
02:40:11,560 --> 02:40:13,720
available to the public so that's an

3511
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:16,560
important uh fact that I want to make

3512
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:19,760
clear and uh I think this is because it

3513
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:22,560
wasn't made public in this case and uh

3514
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:25,200
Ronco actually recognized that they were

3515
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:28,439
aware of it through and this is at

3516
02:40:28,439 --> 02:40:30,600
paragraph nine of their amended

3517
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:33,479
statement of claim they were aware of it

3518
02:40:33,479 --> 02:40:36,080
because they relied in importing the

3519
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:38,279
goods under tariff 21 they relied on the

3520
02:40:38,279 --> 02:40:40,800
advice of their custom

3521
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:43,279
Brokers without securing one for

3522
02:40:43,279 --> 02:40:45,000
themselves there's nothing in the the

3523
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,160
regime that would have prevented Ronco

3524
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:50,600
from securing an advance ruling actually

3525
02:40:50,600 --> 02:40:53,880
um the CB the cbsa also has a memorandum

3526
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:58,880
on on Advance ruling and and it ain't

3527
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:02,399
it importers are encouraged to seek

3528
02:41:02,399 --> 02:41:04,040
Advanced rulings when they want to

3529
02:41:04,040 --> 02:41:06,160
benefit from the certainty that it

3530
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:08,800
brings and also from the you know the

3531
02:41:08,800 --> 02:41:11,399
benefit that you can you can impose

3532
02:41:11,399 --> 02:41:13,279
retroactive duties when there was an

3533
02:41:13,279 --> 02:41:16,160
advance ruling uh you can just go impose

3534
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:18,359
the new duties or the new tarf item

3535
02:41:18,359 --> 02:41:21,240
going forward

3536
02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:25,560
so so any so any importers every

3537
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:27,319
importers can get an advance ruling on

3538
02:41:27,319 --> 02:41:29,200
any Goods even though the goods were

3539
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:32,560
already the subject of an advance ruling

3540
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:36,160
uh my question so thank you yeah yeah

3541
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:38,479
but and so it means that had Rono

3542
02:41:38,479 --> 02:41:42,160
secured an advance ruling like uh like

3543
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:46,479
Sumit Tomo did and had maybe had uh Ron

3544
02:41:46,479 --> 02:41:48,920
CO's uh broker advice told them about

3545
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:51,680
the Ben benefits of an Advan ruling uh

3546
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:53,760
we wouldn't even be before you today

3547
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:55,439
because there wouldn't have been any

3548
02:41:55,439 --> 02:41:56,880
retroactive

3549
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:59,040
duties

3550
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:03,279
um so the advance ruling and the

3551
02:42:03,279 --> 02:42:06,120
treatment of of other importers and of

3552
02:42:06,120 --> 02:42:09,880
sumito might be relevant in the um the

3553
02:42:09,880 --> 02:42:14,120
section 135 action and in this Court's

3554
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:16,359
uh potential determination if Ronco had

3555
02:42:16,359 --> 02:42:18,600
reason to believe or not but it cannot

3556
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:22,439
ground a duty of care uh in this case

3557
02:42:22,439 --> 02:42:24,840
that's our

3558
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:29,120
submission so this concludes my

3559
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:31,520
submissions on the treatment of other

3560
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:34,160
importers in Sumitomo now I I want to

3561
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:36,960
address specifically um the

3562
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:40,880
representations made by a cbsa

3563
02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:43,880
official

3564
02:42:44,359 --> 02:42:47,960
pardon so uh in certain circumstances

3565
02:42:47,960 --> 02:42:49,680
like I said they can't

3566
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:51,439
representations interactions

3567
02:42:51,439 --> 02:42:54,560
undertakings of a public official can

3568
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:56,600
ground or could ground a duty of care

3569
02:42:56,600 --> 02:42:59,240
but not in the circumstances of this

3570
02:42:59,240 --> 02:43:03,160
case just as a factual little reminder

3571
02:43:03,160 --> 02:43:06,080
uh as you know it's the interim

3572
02:43:06,080 --> 02:43:08,840
verification report was issued in late

3573
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:10,520
April

3574
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:14,040
2018 uh the alleged uh representations

3575
02:43:14,040 --> 02:43:17,359
happened during a meeting uh with a cbsa

3576
02:43:17,359 --> 02:43:21,760
official that happened on June 26

3577
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:24,279
2018 and then the final verification

3578
02:43:24,279 --> 02:43:25,520
report which

3579
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:28,359
allegedly uh goes contrary to what was

3580
02:43:28,359 --> 02:43:30,840
said during the June meeting this final

3581
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:33,279
verification report was uh issued in

3582
02:43:33,279 --> 02:43:37,640
Late July 205 so there was only a month

3583
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:39,760
between the representation and the the

3584
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:42,279
determination the final verification

3585
02:43:42,279 --> 02:43:45,760
report I just want to uh make that those

3586
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:48,319
facts clear as they arep final just just

3587
02:43:48,319 --> 02:43:49,800
so I'm clear I thought I heard you say

3588
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:51,479
the final verification report was in

3589
02:43:51,479 --> 02:43:57,439
July 2015 sorry 2018 2018 yes

3590
02:43:58,439 --> 02:44:02,880
yeah so uh our F the respon the the

3591
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:05,120
fant's first point on that is that the

3592
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:07,960
cbsa is required to apply the Customs

3593
02:44:07,960 --> 02:44:10,560
tariff and Customs legislation in the

3594
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:12,680
correct matter regardless of what

3595
02:44:12,680 --> 02:44:16,200
representations may have been made by an

3596
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:18,520
official that's my our first point but

3597
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:20,520
second the second point and more

3598
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:23,479
importantly uh Ronco here does does not

3599
02:44:23,479 --> 02:44:25,520
plead that they rely on those

3600
02:44:25,520 --> 02:44:27,760
representation if you uh look at the

3601
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:29,840
pleadings even if you uh give it a

3602
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:32,160
generous interpretation that's not what

3603
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:35,840
they're saying and this this is easily

3604
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:38,359
understandable because uh a little under

3605
02:44:38,359 --> 02:44:42,479
one month happened between the the the

3606
02:44:42,479 --> 02:44:45,240
meeting and the final verification

3607
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:48,560
report um Ronco does not also plead

3608
02:44:48,560 --> 02:44:51,160
causation so they don't plead that uh

3609
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:53,840
the representations and Reliance on them

3610
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:56,279
cause them damages this is nowhere to be

3611
02:44:56,279 --> 02:44:59,080
found in the amended statement of claim

3612
02:44:59,080 --> 02:45:02,880
and this is why we submit that this uh

3613
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:05,439
cannot ground a duty of teror and so

3614
02:45:05,439 --> 02:45:07,640
that uh the claim in negligence should

3615
02:45:07,640 --> 02:45:10,720
be struck on that basis

3616
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:13,000
also

3617
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:16,200
um so a proper pleaded Tor pleads all

3618
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:18,359
the elements of the material facts in

3619
02:45:18,359 --> 02:45:19,640
support of the

3620
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:23,439
elements um he so and when you plead

3621
02:45:23,439 --> 02:45:27,080
negligence uh through representation and

3622
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:30,840
and uh you have and undertakings made by

3623
02:45:30,840 --> 02:45:32,520
a Public Authority you have to plead

3624
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:35,080
Reliance and you have to plead causation

3625
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:38,359
that Reliance on that caus you a loss or

3626
02:45:38,359 --> 02:45:42,439
an injury and I refer the court uh to uh

3627
02:45:42,439 --> 02:45:45,800
the case of Charles fer Charles fer of

3628
02:45:45,800 --> 02:45:48,960
the Ontario uh court of appeal which

3629
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:53,760
which is found at tab 17 of our book of

3630
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:58,000
authorities at uh simply just paragraph

3631
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:01,479
31 and 40 uh I don't think we need to go

3632
02:46:01,479 --> 02:46:04,640
into them but it they clearly shows that

3633
02:46:04,640 --> 02:46:07,040
uh you you have to plead Reliance and

3634
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:09,520
you have to plead causation when you uh

3635
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:11,319
you assert damages flowing from

3636
02:46:11,319 --> 02:46:13,600
representations of a Public

3637
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:17,680
Authority uh this was also uh this is

3638
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:19,840
also confirmed in Imperial tobacco as

3639
02:46:19,840 --> 02:46:23,000
well at paragraph

3640
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:26,600
42 so and when reading the amended

3641
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:28,960
statement of claim it is clear that the

3642
02:46:28,960 --> 02:46:31,880
plaintiff is is not claiming that they

3643
02:46:31,880 --> 02:46:34,439
suffered damages because they relied on

3644
02:46:34,439 --> 02:46:37,800
the cbsa officials representations but

3645
02:46:37,800 --> 02:46:41,240
rather more simply that uh they were

3646
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:43,640
they suffered damages because they were

3647
02:46:43,640 --> 02:46:45,960
subjected to a verification and they

3648
02:46:45,960 --> 02:46:49,359
were imposed the duties at issue uh uh

3649
02:46:49,359 --> 02:46:51,120
and the other players in the industry

3650
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:53,720
were not this is the Crux of their

3651
02:46:53,720 --> 02:46:56,520
claiming negligence and the represent

3652
02:46:56,520 --> 02:47:00,439
the interactions with uh um with the

3653
02:47:00,439 --> 02:47:06,080
cbsa official uh are should are

3654
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:08,600
inconsequential uh on the pleadings as

3655
02:47:08,600 --> 02:47:11,880
they are before you so and I just to

3656
02:47:11,880 --> 02:47:13,680
illustrate that I will refer you to

3657
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:16,960
paragraph 16 and 17 of their amended

3658
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:19,640
statement of claim where

3659
02:47:19,640 --> 02:47:21,760
what I just said is made pretty

3660
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:30,200
clear um paragraph 63 to sorry 53 to

3661
02:47:30,240 --> 02:47:37,800
54 and also in paragraph uh 64 C 64

3662
02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:42,000
C so again like I said with Sumit Tomo

3663
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:45,000
the representations made by do by Doug

3664
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,760
Ben the cbsa official May well be

3665
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:51,160
relevant in the section 135 action which

3666
02:47:51,160 --> 02:47:53,439
is focused on was there a contravention

3667
02:47:53,439 --> 02:47:55,399
to the act so was there reason to

3668
02:47:55,399 --> 02:47:57,399
believe or not that there Declaration

3669
02:47:57,399 --> 02:48:00,279
was incorrect uh so it might be relevant

3670
02:48:00,279 --> 02:48:02,960
for that inquiry but it cannot ground in

3671
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:06,279
the circumstances today a duty of care

3672
02:48:06,279 --> 02:48:08,680
so this concludes my submissions on the

3673
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:11,960
proximity analysis I want to go now

3674
02:48:11,960 --> 02:48:14,520
address the court to uh the second part

3675
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:18,200
of the new duty of car Tesla which is

3676
02:48:18,200 --> 02:48:21,720
about overriding policy considerations

3677
02:48:21,720 --> 02:48:24,319
if that's fine with you justice vent yes

3678
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:28,439
go ahead okay um so even if you would

3679
02:48:28,439 --> 02:48:31,560
recognize that a prima fi uh duty of

3680
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:34,920
care exists or that uh you're not uh you

3681
02:48:34,920 --> 02:48:38,040
don't have the tools to to uh to reject

3682
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:40,279
that duty of Care on this motion to

3683
02:48:40,279 --> 02:48:42,520
strike

3684
02:48:42,520 --> 02:48:45,640
um well just a point on that I in my

3685
02:48:45,640 --> 02:48:47,640
submission on that portion I will

3686
02:48:47,640 --> 02:48:50,000
address some cases where a new duty of

3687
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,439
care was actually rejected on a motion

3688
02:48:52,439 --> 02:48:55,160
to strike so it has been done so it's

3689
02:48:55,160 --> 02:48:59,560
coming bear with me um but yeah um even

3690
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:01,680
if a prima FY duty of care would be

3691
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:05,399
recognized or even if you just want to

3692
02:49:05,399 --> 02:49:08,040
uh look at the second part of the test

3693
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:10,520
strong overriding policy considerations

3694
02:49:10,520 --> 02:49:13,479
negate a duty of care in this

3695
02:49:13,479 --> 02:49:17,080
case um now so the the analysis is

3696
02:49:17,080 --> 02:49:19,200
different right than with the first part

3697
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:21,680
of the stage uh the court will have to

3698
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:23,800
look at the effect of recognizing a duty

3699
02:49:23,800 --> 02:49:28,000
of Care on other legal obligations on uh

3700
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,560
the legal system or the legal regime at

3701
02:49:30,560 --> 02:49:33,479
play and on society in general that's

3702
02:49:33,479 --> 02:49:36,120
how it's been uh describe this part the

3703
02:49:36,120 --> 02:49:38,640
second part of the test is is the court

3704
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:40,359
really in position to do that on a

3705
02:49:40,359 --> 02:49:41,600
motion to

3706
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:46,760
strike uh yes impact uh sounds like uh

3707
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:48,319
like there there might be requirements

3708
02:49:48,319 --> 02:49:50,520
for some evidence to ban some of these

3709
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:53,359
arguments on the policy

3710
02:49:53,359 --> 02:49:56,239
side B we will We I will go through some

3711
02:49:56,239 --> 02:49:59,279
of the cases uh later on but we we our

3712
02:49:59,279 --> 02:50:02,319
position is that no you you can't uh

3713
02:50:02,319 --> 02:50:04,359
appropriately uh look at that second

3714
02:50:04,359 --> 02:50:07,120
stage on a motion to strike okay and I

3715
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:09,160
will uh I will talk about the reasons

3716
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:11,359
why uh you don't necessarily need

3717
02:50:11,359 --> 02:50:14,680
evidence to conclude as

3718
02:50:14,680 --> 02:50:18,680
such um

3719
02:50:20,239 --> 02:50:24,160
so the first our our one of our

3720
02:50:24,160 --> 02:50:26,080
submissions on that is that finding a

3721
02:50:26,080 --> 02:50:29,520
duty of care based on the elements uh

3722
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:32,560
that are listed by Ronco at paragraph 61

3723
02:50:32,560 --> 02:50:35,600
of their amended statement of claim um

3724
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:37,880
seriously risk opening the door to

3725
02:50:37,880 --> 02:50:39,439
indeterminate

3726
02:50:39,439 --> 02:50:42,920
liability um so and I've and I've

3727
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:46,120
touched upon it this is based on um how

3728
02:50:46,120 --> 02:50:49,200
a duty of care based on the cbsa

3729
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:51,520
verification and imposition of Duties on

3730
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:53,880
one importer and not necessarily on

3731
02:50:53,880 --> 02:50:57,520
other importers in an industry

3732
02:50:57,520 --> 02:51:01,239
uh and the failure of the cbsa to assess

3733
02:51:01,239 --> 02:51:04,160
the financial impact of those uh

3734
02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:07,920
statutory duties on an importer and an

3735
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:10,640
industry uh would it is our submission

3736
02:51:10,640 --> 02:51:13,720
that it would make render the regime

3737
02:51:13,720 --> 02:51:16,359
unmanageable uh I've set out it's not

3738
02:51:16,359 --> 02:51:18,359
required by the regime but we think that

3739
02:51:18,359 --> 02:51:20,720
it it would render it unmanageable and

3740
02:51:20,720 --> 02:51:23,120
it would open the door to indeterminate

3741
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:25,520
liability and I know some sometimes

3742
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:27,239
people will say well you can't just

3743
02:51:27,239 --> 02:51:31,080
throw that um policy in the air but this

3744
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:33,640
is what this is this is what it's FedEd

3745
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:35,680
in the amended statement of claim they

3746
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:38,520
claimed that the cbsa targeted them

3747
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:40,840
because they verified only them then

3748
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:43,680
because they didn't impose or verify uh

3749
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:46,960
duties on other uh on other importers

3750
02:51:46,960 --> 02:51:51,439
and that uh caused to uh to you know to

3751
02:51:51,439 --> 02:51:53,840
that interfered with uh the competitive

3752
02:51:53,840 --> 02:51:57,120
landscape of the Railway uh or Railway

3753
02:51:57,120 --> 02:51:58,359
Wheels

3754
02:51:58,359 --> 02:52:02,520
industry um so they claim the plaintiff

3755
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:05,600
claims that uh with uh you know coupled

3756
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:07,720
with the dog bin interactions and the

3757
02:52:07,720 --> 02:52:10,560
facts of this case uh the circumstances

3758
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:12,920
are uncommon and that it wouldn't open

3759
02:52:12,920 --> 02:52:15,640
the door to indeterminate liability uh

3760
02:52:15,640 --> 02:52:18,600
we strongly disagree of course the

3761
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:21,640
circumstances of this case are unique as

3762
02:52:21,640 --> 02:52:23,800
they will they would always be for any

3763
02:52:23,800 --> 02:52:26,920
cases but what the the sources of the

3764
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:30,000
duty of care and what Rono or the

3765
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:33,880
plaintiff claims is not unique the cbsa

3766
02:52:33,880 --> 02:52:36,840
uh conducts random verification on a

3767
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:38,800
daily basis this is part of their

3768
02:52:38,800 --> 02:52:41,920
mandate and they are not required to uh

3769
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:45,239
look at the effects on of their uh of

3770
02:52:45,239 --> 02:52:47,600
the exercise of their statutory duties

3771
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:51,160
on other importers and so we submit that

3772
02:52:51,160 --> 02:52:53,840
recognizing a duty of care as feed by

3773
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:56,960
Ronco in this case would actually open

3774
02:52:56,960 --> 02:52:59,920
the door for any importers that are uh

3775
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:02,880
that are uh verified and imposed duties

3776
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:04,840
and then if they are dissatisfied

3777
02:53:04,840 --> 02:53:07,160
because of the duties because other

3778
02:53:07,160 --> 02:53:10,160
importers uh were not verified or were

3779
02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:12,880
not treated the same way by uh the cbsa

3780
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:16,000
in their view then it would open uh the

3781
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:19,040
possibility to bring a negligence claim

3782
02:53:19,040 --> 02:53:21,600
and we we submit that this is a serious

3783
02:53:21,600 --> 02:53:24,600
consideration that you have to take into

3784
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:28,080
consideration and um we submit that you

3785
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:30,080
don't have you don't need uh to have

3786
02:53:30,080 --> 02:53:34,720
evidence to look at that issue uh

3787
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:37,720
seriously

3788
02:53:40,399 --> 02:53:44,000
um another policy consideration is that

3789
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:47,439
letting this claim in negligence go at

3790
02:53:47,439 --> 02:53:49,600
at for all the damage but at least for

3791
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:52,239
the the duties this got as

3792
02:53:52,239 --> 02:53:55,640
damages uh would uh in effect circumvent

3793
02:53:55,640 --> 02:53:58,800
the proper appeal mechanism that Mr nosb

3794
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:02,239
and told you earlier about um so I think

3795
02:54:02,239 --> 02:54:04,200
this is another policy consideration

3796
02:54:04,200 --> 02:54:06,319
that you have to keep in mind and this

3797
02:54:06,319 --> 02:54:08,640
is uh again a this is more of a legal

3798
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:10,479
argument and it's not based on any

3799
02:54:10,479 --> 02:54:13,920
evidence uh that uh going letting this

3800
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:15,960
claim of negligence go ahead would

3801
02:54:15,960 --> 02:54:17,479
actually frustrate parliament's

3802
02:54:17,479 --> 02:54:18,920
intention

3803
02:54:18,920 --> 02:54:22,239
um to uh that entrusted this the cbsa

3804
02:54:22,239 --> 02:54:24,560
and then to the CIT to deal with the

3805
02:54:24,560 --> 02:54:25,840
validity of

3806
02:54:25,840 --> 02:54:28,840
AAS

3807
02:54:29,120 --> 02:54:33,520
um so this court has struck out claims

3808
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:35,680
very early on in the same context of a

3809
02:54:35,680 --> 02:54:39,279
motion to strike based on uh these

3810
02:54:39,279 --> 02:54:41,520
similar overriding

3811
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:44,319
considerations and um the first one

3812
02:54:44,319 --> 02:54:46,160
we've we cited them in our written

3813
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:49,120
materials the first one being the alasen

3814
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:50,840
V Canada

3815
02:54:50,840 --> 02:54:54,800
case of this court U at tab eight of our

3816
02:54:54,800 --> 02:54:57,000
book of authority the relevant

3817
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:58,600
paragraphs and I don't think we need to

3818
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:01,600
go into them but for your reference are

3819
02:55:01,600 --> 02:55:04,160
uh 53 to

3820
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:07,840
55 um in that case the court concluded

3821
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:12,359
that um so so in that case an applicant

3822
02:55:12,359 --> 02:55:17,200
brought an action um in uh raising

3823
02:55:17,200 --> 02:55:19,680
different grounds of uh

3824
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:23,399
action uh including negligence uh he was

3825
02:55:23,399 --> 02:55:28,560
a failed uh someone who got a a refu um

3826
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:31,840
who got a refusal of an henc uh decision

3827
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:34,439
in the immigration context and sorry I'm

3828
02:55:34,439 --> 02:55:38,279
using uh I'm using acronyms but hnc

3829
02:55:38,279 --> 02:55:40,640
meaning humanitarian and compassionate

3830
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:41,800
ground

3831
02:55:41,800 --> 02:55:46,200
decision by an officer of immigration

3832
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:50,439
Canada and in that in that case um the

3833
02:55:50,439 --> 02:55:52,439
again similarly like in this case the

3834
02:55:52,439 --> 02:55:54,840
applicant was dissatisfied with the way

3835
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:57,960
the decision was made um and the court

3836
02:55:57,960 --> 02:56:01,640
concluded that um an agency decision

3837
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:05,080
cannot be the source of uh a claim in

3838
02:56:05,080 --> 02:56:07,840
negligence because it would uh because

3839
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:09,920
it would basically open the risk of

3840
02:56:09,920 --> 02:56:13,319
indeterminate liability or indeterminate

3841
02:56:13,319 --> 02:56:16,000
possibility for applicants to bring a

3842
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,560
claim in negligence when they uh when

3843
02:56:18,560 --> 02:56:22,239
they fail in this specific immigration

3844
02:56:22,239 --> 02:56:24,600
um

3845
02:56:24,600 --> 02:56:28,479
system um and it also held that that

3846
02:56:28,479 --> 02:56:31,920
would circumvent the the the uh appeal

3847
02:56:31,920 --> 02:56:34,640
mechanism that was a that was uh

3848
02:56:34,640 --> 02:56:36,359
specifically designed by Parliament and

3849
02:56:36,359 --> 02:56:39,080
that culminate in a judicial review in

3850
02:56:39,080 --> 02:56:43,640
this case so uh that's for the Almon

3851
02:56:43,640 --> 02:56:46,160
case and again that this was on a motion

3852
02:56:46,160 --> 02:56:49,720
to strike on in the second case I want

3853
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:52,239
to talk to you about is the swarat case

3854
02:56:52,239 --> 02:56:53,960
v

3855
02:56:53,960 --> 02:56:58,200
Canada at tab 51 of our book of

3856
02:56:58,200 --> 02:57:00,439
authorities again I don't think we need

3857
02:57:00,439 --> 02:57:04,840
to go into it but at paragraph 31 to 32

3858
02:57:04,840 --> 02:57:07,200
are the relevant excerpts that I want to

3859
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:08,520
draw the Court's

3860
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:11,920
attention um so this was a case actually

3861
02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:14,399
involving a bit a bit more similar to

3862
02:57:14,399 --> 02:57:16,319
the case that you have before you

3863
02:57:16,319 --> 02:57:19,319
because it involved uh you commercial

3864
02:57:19,319 --> 02:57:22,720
related damages uh in that case it

3865
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:25,720
involved Health Canada and the whole

3866
02:57:25,720 --> 02:57:28,200
licensing regime of Health product by

3867
02:57:28,200 --> 02:57:29,680
Health

3868
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:33,399
Canada um and in that case um I think

3869
02:57:33,399 --> 02:57:36,080
the facts are that Health Canada first

3870
02:57:36,080 --> 02:57:38,680
granted a license for the health product

3871
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:41,359
to be marketed in Canada and then it

3872
02:57:41,359 --> 02:57:44,239
revoked its licensing based on various

3873
02:57:44,239 --> 02:57:48,200
reasons um but um and that in that case

3874
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:51,520
B on a motion to strike um without

3875
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:56,200
evidence the court concluded that um you

3876
02:57:56,200 --> 02:57:58,880
know if we would let a claim in

3877
02:57:58,880 --> 02:58:02,439
negligence go ahead because uh Health

3878
02:58:02,439 --> 02:58:05,399
Canada was just exercising its statuto

3879
02:58:05,399 --> 02:58:08,160
duties and revoking the license uh it

3880
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:10,439
would open the door to indeterminate

3881
02:58:10,439 --> 02:58:13,520
liability uh and it would be impossible

3882
02:58:13,520 --> 02:58:16,479
for it would be impossible for uh Health

3883
02:58:16,479 --> 02:58:18,640
Canada to assess the economic

3884
02:58:18,640 --> 02:58:22,319
impact uh it's revoking or granting a

3885
02:58:22,319 --> 02:58:26,239
license would have on uh you know on the

3886
02:58:26,239 --> 02:58:28,479
Distributors of of Health Products in

3887
02:58:28,479 --> 02:58:30,840
Canada and and it found that it would

3888
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:33,800
actually just simply run contrary to the

3889
02:58:33,800 --> 02:58:36,279
duties that are vested in in health

3890
02:58:36,279 --> 02:58:39,359
Canada so it is our submission like a

3891
02:58:39,359 --> 02:58:43,080
similar uh reasoning should uh can

3892
02:58:43,080 --> 02:58:46,120
appropriately uh be uh adopted by this

3893
02:58:46,120 --> 02:58:50,760
court in the circumstances of this case

3894
02:58:50,760 --> 02:58:54,840
today so we submit that on the proximity

3895
02:58:54,840 --> 02:58:57,800
uh sorry on the duty of care part and a

3896
02:58:57,800 --> 02:59:00,000
negligence claim um it is plain and

3897
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,200
obvious that this cause of action cannot

3898
02:59:02,200 --> 02:59:04,600
succeed in the circumstances of this

3899
02:59:04,600 --> 02:59:07,000
case based on the facts as alleged in

3900
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:08,960
the amended statement of claim because

3901
02:59:08,960 --> 02:59:10,720
there can be no relationship of

3902
02:59:10,720 --> 02:59:13,680
proximity between the cbsa and the

3903
02:59:13,680 --> 02:59:16,399
plaintiff and there are indeed strong

3904
02:59:16,399 --> 02:59:19,760
policy considerations that uh would that

3905
02:59:19,760 --> 02:59:22,800
negate a uh the recognition of a duty of

3906
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:25,160
care in this case so this would conclude

3907
02:59:25,160 --> 02:59:28,160
my first and uh you know longer point

3908
02:59:28,160 --> 02:59:31,160
that I wanted to raise with you um if

3909
02:59:31,160 --> 02:59:32,880
that's okay with you subject to your

3910
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:35,239
question I would just move on to uh the

3911
02:59:35,239 --> 02:59:37,439
professional fees ahead of

3912
02:59:37,439 --> 02:59:40,200
Damages one deal with the the fees issue

3913
02:59:40,200 --> 02:59:43,120
yes

3914
02:59:45,439 --> 02:59:48,359
okay so as you know the there amended

3915
02:59:48,359 --> 02:59:51,120
statement of claim the plaintiff seeks

3916
02:59:51,120 --> 02:59:55,319
approximatively $1 million uh in Damages

3917
02:59:55,319 --> 02:59:57,000
uh they label it as being for

3918
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:58,920
Professional Services or Prof

3919
02:59:58,920 --> 03:00:01,800
professional fee we believe that those

3920
03:00:01,800 --> 03:00:03,680
this head of Damages should Al should be

3921
03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:06,479
struck because it's not linked to no

3922
03:00:06,479 --> 03:00:09,160
reasonable cause of action and also

3923
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:11,279
because it constitutes an abuse of

3924
03:00:11,279 --> 03:00:13,399
process you can find those they're

3925
03:00:13,399 --> 03:00:16,200
listed in a bit more detail at paragraph

3926
03:00:16,200 --> 03:00:19,920
1 C and 6 7B of their amended statement

3927
03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:22,840
of claim uh according to uh the

3928
03:00:22,840 --> 03:00:24,680
plaintiff they are com those fees are

3929
03:00:24,680 --> 03:00:28,040
comprised of legal fees trade consultant

3930
03:00:28,040 --> 03:00:31,439
fees fees related to the shy bond that

3931
03:00:31,439 --> 03:00:35,640
was uh given to the cbsa and expert

3932
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:37,880
related

3933
03:00:37,880 --> 03:00:42,600
fees um also uh according to the

3934
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:46,920
plaintiff at paragraph um 49 of their

3935
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:48,920
memorandum

3936
03:00:48,920 --> 03:00:52,399
uh those uh fees so the plaintiff claims

3937
03:00:52,399 --> 03:00:55,160
that it is the alleged uh contradictory

3938
03:00:55,160 --> 03:00:57,920
procedural positions that were took by

3939
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:00,560
the cbsa or that they received from the

3940
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:04,080
cbsa and the Attorney General of Canada

3941
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:06,720
that caused them to uh bring multiple

3942
03:01:06,720 --> 03:01:09,439
proceedings and thus uh causing to

3943
03:01:09,439 --> 03:01:12,600
incure those professional

3944
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:15,720
fees and like again this is clearly set

3945
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:19,680
out in paragraph 49 of the

3946
03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:21,439
Factor

3947
03:01:21,439 --> 03:01:25,880
uh so two points on that issue we think

3948
03:01:25,880 --> 03:01:29,040
it should be struck of course I um first

3949
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:33,319
of all we generally submit that um cost

3950
03:01:33,319 --> 03:01:37,359
for pursuing appeal Avenues um and for

3951
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:40,640
contesting customs duties and tariff

3952
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:43,840
classification um cannot be compensable

3953
03:01:43,840 --> 03:01:46,239
as damages because there's no duty of

3954
03:01:46,239 --> 03:01:48,760
care towards importers in that

3955
03:01:48,760 --> 03:01:52,040
guard um to protect them from inuring

3956
03:01:52,040 --> 03:01:53,640
those

3957
03:01:53,640 --> 03:01:56,760
fees um so I we think that this head of

3958
03:01:56,760 --> 03:01:58,880
Damages should be struck on that basis

3959
03:01:58,880 --> 03:02:01,680
alone and I would just like to uh bring

3960
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:07,200
you again to the case of jco V Canada at

3961
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:12,040
at tab 29 of our book of

3962
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:15,640
authority if you can go to

3963
03:02:15,640 --> 03:02:21,120
paragraph 15 to yeah

3964
03:02:26,479 --> 03:02:29,359
15

3965
03:02:29,359 --> 03:02:33,160
yes uh so the the facts are a bit more

3966
03:02:33,160 --> 03:02:35,359
are set out in more details in the the

3967
03:02:35,359 --> 03:02:38,960
paragraphs uh above this but basically

3968
03:02:38,960 --> 03:02:42,960
uh jco uh was assessed uh and sought to

3969
03:02:42,960 --> 03:02:46,239
appeal with the CRA the assessments of

3970
03:02:46,239 --> 03:02:49,920
HST then it s sought to appeal those uh

3971
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:52,319
before the tax Court of Canada and this

3972
03:02:52,319 --> 03:02:55,160
is where um and they were in they were

3973
03:02:55,160 --> 03:02:57,960
actually uh they were actually granted

3974
03:02:57,960 --> 03:03:00,040
what they wanted so they were successful

3975
03:03:00,040 --> 03:03:02,439
in their challenge of the tax assessment

3976
03:03:02,439 --> 03:03:06,319
in this case so at paragraph 15 the tax

3977
03:03:06,319 --> 03:03:09,399
Court upheld jao's position in February

3978
03:03:09,399 --> 03:03:11,960
2018 by the time jaob was able to

3979
03:03:11,960 --> 03:03:13,960
terminate its letter of credit it had

3980
03:03:13,960 --> 03:03:17,200
incured interest charges of uh over 1

3981
03:03:17,200 --> 03:03:20,880
million US Dollars and Consulting fees

3982
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:23,920
of uh

3983
03:03:24,520 --> 03:03:27,359
$242,000 so jco pleads that uh the

3984
03:03:27,359 --> 03:03:28,960
government ought to identify it for

3985
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:32,160
needlessly making it it incure these

3986
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:36,120
costs and so that claim uh was refused

3987
03:03:36,120 --> 03:03:39,040
and if you go to paragraph two and three

3988
03:03:39,040 --> 03:03:41,680
of the same

3989
03:03:45,600 --> 03:03:48,800
decision so there there's a more

3990
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:51,960
informative uh outline of the decision

3991
03:03:51,960 --> 03:03:53,840
paragraph two the plaintiff sued the

3992
03:03:53,840 --> 03:03:55,399
government for Indemnity and for

3993
03:03:55,399 --> 03:03:57,840
negligence and forcing it to incure over

3994
03:03:57,840 --> 03:04:00,319
$1 million in interest expense and

3995
03:04:00,319 --> 03:04:02,640
professional fees to defend an audit and

3996
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:04,520
an agency assessment that were

3997
03:04:04,520 --> 03:04:06,840
undertaken and conducted in bad faith

3998
03:04:06,840 --> 03:04:08,560
the plaintiff succeeded in having the

3999
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:11,160
tax assessment set aside in tax court

4000
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:12,720
but the interest expense and

4001
03:04:12,720 --> 03:04:15,399
professional fees that it incured to do

4002
03:04:15,399 --> 03:04:18,479
so were not recoverable as costs in that

4003
03:04:18,479 --> 03:04:21,279
proceedings and then paragraph three the

4004
03:04:21,279 --> 03:04:23,040
government argues that it has no duty to

4005
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:24,840
indentify the plaintiff for cost dat

4006
03:04:24,840 --> 03:04:27,600
incured in an ancient HST audit and it

4007
03:04:27,600 --> 03:04:29,439
has no private law duty of care to

4008
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:31,640
protect plained from incurring costs in

4009
03:04:31,640 --> 03:04:34,640
a tax audit under applicable statutory

4010
03:04:34,640 --> 03:04:37,920
scheme and then I agree in paragraph

4011
03:04:37,920 --> 03:04:40,640
four so this is our main submission on

4012
03:04:40,640 --> 03:04:43,279
this that generally they cannot claim

4013
03:04:43,279 --> 03:04:46,479
those costs that were a consequences of

4014
03:04:46,479 --> 03:04:49,439
them pursuing different appeal avenues

4015
03:04:49,439 --> 03:04:53,560
that they did uh both with the cbsa and

4016
03:04:53,560 --> 03:04:56,399
then at the CIT and then further before

4017
03:04:56,399 --> 03:04:59,640
this court on judicial review or uh on a

4018
03:04:59,640 --> 03:05:02,960
section 135 action now my second point

4019
03:05:02,960 --> 03:05:04,960
that I want to raise on the professional

4020
03:05:04,960 --> 03:05:08,080
fees is that uh they amount we say that

4021
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:09,920
they amount to an abuse of process

4022
03:05:09,920 --> 03:05:12,920
because um all those those costs that

4023
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:15,120
that are according to the plaintiff

4024
03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:19,479
associated with the pursuing of these uh

4025
03:05:19,479 --> 03:05:22,319
proceedings um cannot be recovered as

4026
03:05:22,319 --> 03:05:24,800
damages because it is our position that

4027
03:05:24,800 --> 03:05:26,439
they should be dealt with more

4028
03:05:26,439 --> 03:05:29,880
appropriately as what they are cost in

4029
03:05:29,880 --> 03:05:30,960
those

4030
03:05:30,960 --> 03:05:33,960
proceedings uh We believe We submit that

4031
03:05:33,960 --> 03:05:37,359
the court should use the doctrine of

4032
03:05:37,359 --> 03:05:41,319
um of um abuse of process pardon to

4033
03:05:41,319 --> 03:05:44,080
strike uh this claim for professional

4034
03:05:44,080 --> 03:05:48,880
fee uh mainly because uh by claiming

4035
03:05:48,880 --> 03:05:51,479
those the plaintiff is actually trying

4036
03:05:51,479 --> 03:05:53,920
to do directly what the law and

4037
03:05:53,920 --> 03:05:57,800
Parliament uh didn't want them to in

4038
03:05:57,800 --> 03:05:59,680
they're trying to do indirectly what the

4039
03:05:59,680 --> 03:06:01,439
law and Parliament didn't want them to

4040
03:06:01,439 --> 03:06:03,319
do uh

4041
03:06:03,319 --> 03:06:06,720
directly uh and I will Pro I

4042
03:06:06,720 --> 03:06:09,120
will provide you with more details on

4043
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:11,200
that position so I would just like to

4044
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:14,319
take every proceedings that were pursued

4045
03:06:14,319 --> 03:06:19,120
one by one there there's maybe four and

4046
03:06:19,120 --> 03:06:23,080
so if you take the first Appeal on to

4047
03:06:23,080 --> 03:06:26,080
the C to um the first appeal was about

4048
03:06:26,080 --> 03:06:28,920
you know the five sample transaction so

4049
03:06:28,920 --> 03:06:32,000
that was pursued through the cvsa levels

4050
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:35,479
and then it culminated in a CIT appeal

4051
03:06:35,479 --> 03:06:37,040
uh so those were on the Tariff

4052
03:06:37,040 --> 03:06:40,960
classification issue so on CIT

4053
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:45,640
appeal uh the a plaintiff or an applant

4054
03:06:45,640 --> 03:06:48,720
more accurately before the CIT is not um

4055
03:06:48,720 --> 03:06:51,720
is not permitted to seek its cost um

4056
03:06:51,720 --> 03:06:53,000
actually

4057
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:56,239
uh the the CIT is simply not empowered

4058
03:06:56,239 --> 03:06:58,720
to award those cost and this was a

4059
03:06:58,720 --> 03:07:01,000
specifically uh this was a specific

4060
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:05,000
Choice made by Parliament and you can uh

4061
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:09,120
easily infer that from um the CIT act

4062
03:07:09,120 --> 03:07:12,279
which is found at tab one uh in other

4063
03:07:12,279 --> 03:07:15,439
matters uh that can be that are under

4064
03:07:15,439 --> 03:07:19,359
the cit's jurisdiction cost can be um

4065
03:07:19,359 --> 03:07:23,040
sought for and can be awarded uh an

4066
03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:25,640
example of that is uh the procurement uh

4067
03:07:25,640 --> 03:07:29,520
complaint proceedings for which CIT has

4068
03:07:29,520 --> 03:07:32,160
jurisdiction um and I just refer you for

4069
03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:35,000
your reference to section

4070
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:36,800
30.1 and

4071
03:07:36,800 --> 03:07:40,760
30.6 of the CIT act in which Parliament

4072
03:07:40,760 --> 03:07:44,160
clearly gave the power to the C to uh

4073
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:47,560
award costs in those proceedings by

4074
03:07:47,560 --> 03:07:50,200
contrast in appeal proceedings before

4075
03:07:50,200 --> 03:07:53,399
the CIT whatever uh the subject of that

4076
03:07:53,399 --> 03:07:55,800
appeal is costs are not

4077
03:07:55,800 --> 03:07:58,399
recoverable parliament's choice is that

4078
03:07:58,399 --> 03:08:02,520
uh each party bear its own cost um and

4079
03:08:02,520 --> 03:08:05,160
so we submit that the plaintiff cannot

4080
03:08:05,160 --> 03:08:08,040
recover any cost associated with that

4081
03:08:08,040 --> 03:08:12,080
Appeal on in indirectly on this action

4082
03:08:12,080 --> 03:08:14,520
um it would be improper and an abusive

4083
03:08:14,520 --> 03:08:16,239
process of the

4084
03:08:16,239 --> 03:08:20,200
cits and this court process as

4085
03:08:20,200 --> 03:08:24,239
well um and just in passing on that not

4086
03:08:24,239 --> 03:08:26,840
on that note sorry any

4087
03:08:26,840 --> 03:08:30,560
uh on that appeal um the the plaintiff

4088
03:08:30,560 --> 03:08:34,319
chose to pursue an argument that the um

4089
03:08:34,319 --> 03:08:37,120
the goods were actually should be uh

4090
03:08:37,120 --> 03:08:40,040
classified under a third tariff item

4091
03:08:40,040 --> 03:08:42,880
which was not uh this the in the

4092
03:08:42,880 --> 03:08:46,760
verification uh and so any uh any cost

4093
03:08:46,760 --> 03:08:49,239
related to that that appeal uh is based

4094
03:08:49,239 --> 03:08:52,720
on their own uh choice to pursue uh that

4095
03:08:52,720 --> 03:08:54,760
line of argument which was found by the

4096
03:08:54,760 --> 03:08:57,359
CIT to be uh

4097
03:08:57,359 --> 03:09:02,479
unfounded um so and then um you know

4098
03:09:02,479 --> 03:09:06,120
they following the alleged inconsistent

4099
03:09:06,120 --> 03:09:08,399
uh information that they received from

4100
03:09:08,399 --> 03:09:09,600
the

4101
03:09:09,600 --> 03:09:13,439
cbsa uh the plaintiff actually uh

4102
03:09:13,439 --> 03:09:17,760
comments three other proceedings um but

4103
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:20,160
first there was the the the appeal of

4104
03:09:20,160 --> 03:09:22,279
the notice of penalty and this section

4105
03:09:22,279 --> 03:09:26,279
135 appeal then there was a uh judicial

4106
03:09:26,279 --> 03:09:29,640
review application before this court in

4107
03:09:29,640 --> 03:09:33,040
2020 in August 2020 and then an appeal

4108
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:37,479
to uh of the July 2020 death to the CIT

4109
03:09:37,479 --> 03:09:40,760
um also in 2020 I think in October

4110
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:44,120
2020 um so regarding that second appeal

4111
03:09:44,120 --> 03:09:46,760
to the CIT the same submissions that

4112
03:09:46,760 --> 03:09:50,920
I've just told told you about uh apply

4113
03:09:50,920 --> 03:09:54,040
uh in the same matter they a party

4114
03:09:54,040 --> 03:09:57,479
cannot claim as damages what uh it was

4115
03:09:57,479 --> 03:10:00,399
directly uh precluded to do so before

4116
03:10:00,399 --> 03:10:01,439
the

4117
03:10:01,439 --> 03:10:04,439
CIT also we submit that the cost of the

4118
03:10:04,439 --> 03:10:07,279
Jr should more appropriately dealt with

4119
03:10:07,279 --> 03:10:10,640
within that Jr if it ever goes ahead and

4120
03:10:10,640 --> 03:10:12,439
also the cost of this current section

4121
03:10:12,439 --> 03:10:15,160
135 appeal should also be dealt with

4122
03:10:15,160 --> 03:10:17,960
more appropriately as damages

4123
03:10:17,960 --> 03:10:21,279
um sorry as cost in that

4124
03:10:21,279 --> 03:10:24,080
proceedings now another point that I

4125
03:10:24,080 --> 03:10:27,200
wanted to raise which further supports

4126
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:30,399
how this claim of Damages is

4127
03:10:30,399 --> 03:10:33,800
inappropriate and an abusive process as

4128
03:10:33,800 --> 03:10:36,760
as as I've said already the plaintiff

4129
03:10:36,760 --> 03:10:40,120
makes the link between those damages and

4130
03:10:40,120 --> 03:10:43,439
the bad advice it received first from an

4131
03:10:43,439 --> 03:10:45,239
officer in

4132
03:10:45,239 --> 03:10:49,319
2018 and then and then much later on in

4133
03:10:49,319 --> 03:10:50,439
August

4134
03:10:50,439 --> 03:10:53,399
2020 and then in from another cbsa

4135
03:10:53,399 --> 03:10:57,000
official and then in October 2020 advice

4136
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,160
that they would have received or

4137
03:10:59,160 --> 03:11:02,120
information from Council for the

4138
03:11:02,120 --> 03:11:06,200
defendant uh so uh we submit that the

4139
03:11:06,200 --> 03:11:08,319
position any positions Advanced by the

4140
03:11:08,319 --> 03:11:10,880
defendant Council in the context of

4141
03:11:10,880 --> 03:11:12,520
these L this

4142
03:11:12,520 --> 03:11:15,960
litigation uh cannot cannot constitute a

4143
03:11:15,960 --> 03:11:17,840
breach of Duty of care and cannot give

4144
03:11:17,840 --> 03:11:21,399
rise to uh damages in professional

4145
03:11:21,399 --> 03:11:24,200
fees uh and this is be and I refer you

4146
03:11:24,200 --> 03:11:28,399
to the case of B BMA V mcferson of this

4147
03:11:28,399 --> 03:11:33,120
court which is found at Tab 10

4148
03:11:33,120 --> 03:11:35,080
nine

4149
03:11:35,080 --> 03:11:40,080
um the paragraph uh of interest is

4150
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:43,160
26d where uh the court clearly states

4151
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:45,840
that uh what councils did say or did not

4152
03:11:45,840 --> 03:11:49,279
say or the position Council took in the

4153
03:11:49,279 --> 03:11:52,160
context of litigation cannot ground a

4154
03:11:52,160 --> 03:11:55,200
duty of care because by Nature Council

4155
03:11:55,200 --> 03:11:57,680
for the other side owes no duty of care

4156
03:11:57,680 --> 03:12:01,479
to the other to the to the other side uh

4157
03:12:01,479 --> 03:12:03,479
and in that sense their interest are

4158
03:12:03,479 --> 03:12:06,520
plainly adverse so it cannot give rise

4159
03:12:06,520 --> 03:12:09,399
to any claim in negligence or any

4160
03:12:09,399 --> 03:12:12,239
damages um flowing from

4161
03:12:12,239 --> 03:12:14,399
that

4162
03:12:14,399 --> 03:12:17,319
um yeah they also the plaintive also

4163
03:12:17,319 --> 03:12:20,000
raises in the head in that the

4164
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:22,439
professional fee head of Damages the shy

4165
03:12:22,439 --> 03:12:26,239
Bond we just know and passing the sh T

4166
03:12:26,239 --> 03:12:28,560
Bond it cannot be an issue of

4167
03:12:28,560 --> 03:12:31,080
Damages uh the whole purpose of a shy

4168
03:12:31,080 --> 03:12:32,920
bond is to

4169
03:12:32,920 --> 03:12:36,840
secure payment so if C the CBS if the

4170
03:12:36,840 --> 03:12:39,399
plaintiff was uh successful in

4171
03:12:39,399 --> 03:12:41,520
challenging the validity of the July

4172
03:12:41,520 --> 03:12:45,120
2020 D then uh the cbsa would have to

4173
03:12:45,120 --> 03:12:47,960
remit the sh T Bond and any Mone is

4174
03:12:47,960 --> 03:12:51,319
associated with it so it cannot be an

4175
03:12:51,319 --> 03:12:53,520
issue of

4176
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:56,279
Damages which brings me to my four my

4177
03:12:56,279 --> 03:13:01,040
third main point which uh can be very

4178
03:13:01,040 --> 03:13:04,200
short uh regarding uh how the general

4179
03:13:04,200 --> 03:13:07,120
claim for the claim for General damages

4180
03:13:07,120 --> 03:13:10,359
is pleaded uh we submit that this claim

4181
03:13:10,359 --> 03:13:13,239
as pleaded is bound to fail as well

4182
03:13:13,239 --> 03:13:15,560
because uh it's not properly

4183
03:13:15,560 --> 03:13:17,960
pleaded um

4184
03:13:17,960 --> 03:13:22,239
we submit that uh the pl the even

4185
03:13:22,239 --> 03:13:26,479
reading the the pleadings generously

4186
03:13:26,479 --> 03:13:29,479
trying to understand it the defendant is

4187
03:13:29,479 --> 03:13:31,960
left with uh a lot of questions

4188
03:13:31,960 --> 03:13:35,040
regarding that 1 million doll in general

4189
03:13:35,040 --> 03:13:36,720
damages

4190
03:13:36,720 --> 03:13:40,640
um that those damages are all are only

4191
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:43,680
referenced in two paragraphs of the

4192
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:45,000
statement of

4193
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:49,080
claim and those are one B and

4194
03:13:49,080 --> 03:13:52,080
67

4195
03:13:52,080 --> 03:13:55,520
a so we don't know what those General

4196
03:13:55,520 --> 03:13:58,439
damages are for namely we don't know

4197
03:13:58,439 --> 03:14:00,600
what's that what's the injury what's the

4198
03:14:00,600 --> 03:14:03,200
loss here this is an important element

4199
03:14:03,200 --> 03:14:06,840
that someone has to clean and uh they

4200
03:14:06,840 --> 03:14:09,800
also have to uh provide enough material

4201
03:14:09,800 --> 03:14:13,479
elements in support um enough material

4202
03:14:13,479 --> 03:14:15,680
fact in support of that

4203
03:14:15,680 --> 03:14:18,720
element um

4204
03:14:18,720 --> 03:14:21,080
now the plaintiffs argues that they

4205
03:14:21,080 --> 03:14:23,840
don't have to provide a breakdown of

4206
03:14:23,840 --> 03:14:28,680
what ENT what this $1 million damages is

4207
03:14:28,680 --> 03:14:29,960
uh they don't have that they don't have

4208
03:14:29,960 --> 03:14:33,120
to particularize those damages we don't

4209
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:36,239
necessarily disagree actually uh but I

4210
03:14:36,239 --> 03:14:39,239
think this is a misund they conflates

4211
03:14:39,239 --> 03:14:42,319
the compensable amount that are that

4212
03:14:42,319 --> 03:14:45,439
constitute this $1 million with the loss

4213
03:14:45,439 --> 03:14:47,680
or the injury and that that's what the

4214
03:14:47,680 --> 03:14:49,880
defendant is missing here to properly

4215
03:14:49,880 --> 03:14:52,600
plead against uh this $1

4216
03:14:52,600 --> 03:14:55,160
million uh General claim in Damages we

4217
03:14:55,160 --> 03:14:58,040
don't know what what caused this we

4218
03:14:58,040 --> 03:15:00,479
don't know what it is it for is it for

4219
03:15:00,479 --> 03:15:04,359
loss of profit is it for so we submit

4220
03:15:04,359 --> 03:15:07,080
that the pleadings are deficient in that

4221
03:15:07,080 --> 03:15:11,120
regard and just in passing the lack of

4222
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:14,279
specifics regarding that heading of

4223
03:15:14,279 --> 03:15:20,120
Damages uh to to us it signal that um it

4224
03:15:20,120 --> 03:15:21,920
should signal to the court we submit

4225
03:15:21,920 --> 03:15:25,239
that uh it it also

4226
03:15:25,239 --> 03:15:29,760
uh it also shows how um the essential

4227
03:15:29,760 --> 03:15:32,640
character of the plaintiff's claim is

4228
03:15:32,640 --> 03:15:35,640
based in public CL remedies with only a

4229
03:15:35,640 --> 03:15:39,800
private uh pretense to uh with only a

4230
03:15:39,800 --> 03:15:42,800
thin pretense to a private wrong and

4231
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:45,960
this this lack of specifics uh supports

4232
03:15:45,960 --> 03:15:48,040
that in our submission

4233
03:15:48,040 --> 03:15:51,560
so I now I would just like to address

4234
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:53,800
just a few minutes the court on the

4235
03:15:53,800 --> 03:15:56,880
estole argument if that's okay with you

4236
03:15:56,880 --> 03:15:58,319
justice

4237
03:15:58,319 --> 03:16:01,439
gon yes go ahead I'll he you second yeah

4238
03:16:01,439 --> 03:16:03,720
so this uh this argument was raised by

4239
03:16:03,720 --> 03:16:06,199
the applicant in their submissions in

4240
03:16:06,199 --> 03:16:08,760
their written

4241
03:16:09,600 --> 03:16:13,960
factum so uh they claimed that the cbsa

4242
03:16:13,960 --> 03:16:17,199
is precluded from taking from making the

4243
03:16:17,199 --> 03:16:19,000
jurisdictional arguments that we made

4244
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:21,640
today before this court this court

4245
03:16:21,640 --> 03:16:24,880
because uh the cbsa allegedly provided

4246
03:16:24,880 --> 03:16:28,840
to cbsa contrad and the agc2 provided

4247
03:16:28,840 --> 03:16:31,399
contradictory procedural positions to

4248
03:16:31,399 --> 03:16:34,319
Ronco in the past namely that uh the

4249
03:16:34,319 --> 03:16:36,399
reason to believe issue should be

4250
03:16:36,399 --> 03:16:39,040
pursued through uh the the penalty

4251
03:16:39,040 --> 03:16:41,640
appeal scheme and then uh the

4252
03:16:41,640 --> 03:16:43,800
reassessment policy should be uh

4253
03:16:43,800 --> 03:16:47,439
appealed to um through a judicial review

4254
03:16:47,439 --> 03:16:51,880
before the federal court so uh B we we

4255
03:16:51,880 --> 03:16:54,880
we disagree with the characterization of

4256
03:16:54,880 --> 03:16:57,359
the thisinformation that was given by

4257
03:16:57,359 --> 03:17:00,800
that that is alleged by uh the plaintiff

4258
03:17:00,800 --> 03:17:03,359
but I don't think that uh this court

4259
03:17:03,359 --> 03:17:06,279
needs to look into that evidence at all

4260
03:17:06,279 --> 03:17:09,279
to dispose of this uh argument of a

4261
03:17:09,279 --> 03:17:13,239
stole in this case uh we our submission

4262
03:17:13,239 --> 03:17:15,399
is that it's just it just simply doesn't

4263
03:17:15,399 --> 03:17:18,239
apply in this case

4264
03:17:18,239 --> 03:17:20,800
based solely on on legal

4265
03:17:20,800 --> 03:17:25,199
considerations um so for and or or on

4266
03:17:25,199 --> 03:17:27,800
how the facts are pleaded in the

4267
03:17:27,800 --> 03:17:31,800
pleadings uh so for as you know for the

4268
03:17:31,800 --> 03:17:35,120
doctrine of promis reople to apply uh

4269
03:17:35,120 --> 03:17:38,520
there are four conditions to uh that you

4270
03:17:38,520 --> 03:17:40,880
have to meet we submit that the

4271
03:17:40,880 --> 03:17:43,319
plaintiff in this case uh does not meet

4272
03:17:43,319 --> 03:17:46,920
the first condition which is that uh an

4273
03:17:46,920 --> 03:17:50,520
Authority has to have made a promise or

4274
03:17:50,520 --> 03:17:52,880
an undertakings or an assurance

4275
03:17:52,880 --> 03:17:55,920
Assurance by words or by conduct that

4276
03:17:55,920 --> 03:17:58,439
they will do something and not something

4277
03:17:58,439 --> 03:18:01,760
else uh so the purpose of the doctrine

4278
03:18:01,760 --> 03:18:05,720
is to um prevent an Public Authority

4279
03:18:05,720 --> 03:18:10,279
from deviating from its original uh

4280
03:18:10,279 --> 03:18:13,000
undertaking um in the public law context

4281
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:15,840
it has been said that this Doctrine must

4282
03:18:15,840 --> 03:18:20,160
yield yield pardon um when uh there's an

4283
03:18:20,160 --> 03:18:23,080
overriding public interest

4284
03:18:23,080 --> 03:18:27,680
uh at play or when uh it would frustrate

4285
03:18:27,680 --> 03:18:30,479
uh the express application of a

4286
03:18:30,479 --> 03:18:32,359
legislative

4287
03:18:32,359 --> 03:18:35,160
provision um and it Al it has also been

4288
03:18:35,160 --> 03:18:36,880
said that the promise or the

4289
03:18:36,880 --> 03:18:39,080
undertakings must be lawful or

4290
03:18:39,080 --> 03:18:41,840
consistent with a statutory power or

4291
03:18:41,840 --> 03:18:46,840
discretion so it it it has it it has to

4292
03:18:46,840 --> 03:18:49,520
be not unlawful or inconsistent with

4293
03:18:49,520 --> 03:18:52,720
that statutory power said otherwise and

4294
03:18:52,720 --> 03:18:54,920
I just refer you to the cases that were

4295
03:18:54,920 --> 03:18:58,279
cited by the applicant in that regard

4296
03:18:58,279 --> 03:19:03,160
imar vbec at paragraph 20 to 21 tap 10

4297
03:19:03,160 --> 03:19:04,880
of their book of

4298
03:19:04,880 --> 03:19:08,840
authorities um the this court also in

4299
03:19:08,840 --> 03:19:11,279
the case of Samsung has said that the

4300
03:19:11,279 --> 03:19:13,640
doctrine is very narrow in the public

4301
03:19:13,640 --> 03:19:15,080
law

4302
03:19:15,080 --> 03:19:18,319
context this is found that tab uh oops I

4303
03:19:18,319 --> 03:19:20,520
forgot I didn't have but it's found in

4304
03:19:20,520 --> 03:19:24,479
the plaintiff's book of

4305
03:19:24,520 --> 03:19:27,319
authorities so yes again we submit that

4306
03:19:27,319 --> 03:19:30,920
there was no promise made uh if you take

4307
03:19:30,920 --> 03:19:32,800
the facts as feeded there was no

4308
03:19:32,800 --> 03:19:36,720
undertakings made uh and no exercise of

4309
03:19:36,720 --> 03:19:37,560
uh

4310
03:19:37,560 --> 03:19:40,800
discretion uh I we believe that the what

4311
03:19:40,800 --> 03:19:43,439
was provided to the applicant was just

4312
03:19:43,439 --> 03:19:46,160
uh recourse information from cbsa

4313
03:19:46,160 --> 03:19:48,920
official on what they thought to be uh

4314
03:19:48,920 --> 03:19:50,319
accurate at the time or what they

4315
03:19:50,319 --> 03:19:54,520
understood from the plaintiff's uh

4316
03:19:54,520 --> 03:19:57,199
request

4317
03:19:57,199 --> 03:20:00,199
um and so that Doctrine and what was

4318
03:20:00,199 --> 03:20:04,000
said by the cbsa official cannot um

4319
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:06,840
cannot even if it was made in error uh

4320
03:20:06,840 --> 03:20:10,439
cannot Grant cannot Grant this court

4321
03:20:10,439 --> 03:20:14,399
jurisdiction um and cannot uh determine

4322
03:20:14,399 --> 03:20:18,040
what is the proper appeal root to what

4323
03:20:18,040 --> 03:20:22,600
the plaintiff is is seeking um so we we

4324
03:20:22,600 --> 03:20:24,920
say that to conclude otherwise would be

4325
03:20:24,920 --> 03:20:27,880
to let the doctrine of promis re estole

4326
03:20:27,880 --> 03:20:31,160
dictate uh go against parliament's

4327
03:20:31,160 --> 03:20:33,800
intent and dictate this Court's

4328
03:20:33,800 --> 03:20:37,040
jurisdictions and the cit's jurisdiction

4329
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:39,239
so um there was no so there was no

4330
03:20:39,239 --> 03:20:41,920
promise made or nor undertaking just

4331
03:20:41,920 --> 03:20:45,000
information provided and then even if

4332
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:49,319
there was a promise Tak can or made um

4333
03:20:49,319 --> 03:20:52,880
it simply cannot uh Define the legal

4334
03:20:52,880 --> 03:20:58,199
issues of jurisdiction in this case

4335
03:20:59,600 --> 03:21:04,520
um and I would note in passing that um

4336
03:21:04,520 --> 03:21:06,640
Ronco may have relied on this

4337
03:21:06,640 --> 03:21:09,479
information provided that this provided

4338
03:21:09,479 --> 03:21:13,000
by the cbsa to bring a a section 135

4339
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:17,040
action but they did not lose any rights

4340
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:20,040
they still filed a Jr in time they still

4341
03:21:20,040 --> 03:21:23,279
filed a CIT appeal in time so their

4342
03:21:23,279 --> 03:21:26,600
rights are preserved um and generally

4343
03:21:26,600 --> 03:21:29,479
there's no uh consequences on on that

4344
03:21:29,479 --> 03:21:31,439
front and there's no we submit there's

4345
03:21:31,439 --> 03:21:34,920
no access to justice issue in this case

4346
03:21:34,920 --> 03:21:37,880
so those are subm my submissions on the

4347
03:21:37,880 --> 03:21:41,760
promisory stop all issue um I would be

4348
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:44,199
ready to conclude subject to any

4349
03:21:44,199 --> 03:21:46,680
question from the court

4350
03:21:46,680 --> 03:21:48,800
I have no questions on on the stoppable

4351
03:21:48,800 --> 03:21:52,399
issue Mr Mayor thank you very much thank

4352
03:21:52,399 --> 03:21:55,600
you so just to sum it up I know uh We've

4353
03:21:55,600 --> 03:21:58,160
passed over an hour and uh we still have

4354
03:21:58,160 --> 03:21:59,760
the other side's argument to go through

4355
03:21:59,760 --> 03:22:03,399
but we we submit that the amended

4356
03:22:03,399 --> 03:22:05,279
statement of claim is deficient in many

4357
03:22:05,279 --> 03:22:07,720
respects and that large portion of it

4358
03:22:07,720 --> 03:22:10,960
should be struck without leave to amend

4359
03:22:10,960 --> 03:22:13,319
um first of all because it seeks to have

4360
03:22:13,319 --> 03:22:16,520
the July 2020 death and it's associated

4361
03:22:16,520 --> 03:22:19,199
duties cancelled under the guise of an

4362
03:22:19,199 --> 03:22:20,399
award of

4363
03:22:20,399 --> 03:22:22,760
Damages uh we submit that this claim is

4364
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:25,880
a collateral attack actually on the cbsa

4365
03:22:25,880 --> 03:22:28,560
July 2020 decision with only a thin

4366
03:22:28,560 --> 03:22:30,880
pretense to a private

4367
03:22:30,880 --> 03:22:34,720
wrong uh and we submit that the amended

4368
03:22:34,720 --> 03:22:36,960
statement of claim is precisely what the

4369
03:22:36,960 --> 03:22:40,640
Supreme Court of Canada uh warned the

4370
03:22:40,640 --> 03:22:44,199
court uh from which is Artful fading

4371
03:22:44,199 --> 03:22:47,040
that makes look a claim uh

4372
03:22:47,040 --> 03:22:50,479
to to find its sources in private law

4373
03:22:50,479 --> 03:22:53,439
where uh it is it Finds Its sources more

4374
03:22:53,439 --> 03:22:56,720
appropriately in public law

4375
03:22:56,720 --> 03:23:01,120
um the the proper Forum um is to

4376
03:23:01,120 --> 03:23:04,080
challenge the D in the validity of the D

4377
03:23:04,080 --> 03:23:07,640
is the CIT as the as it was decided in

4378
03:23:07,640 --> 03:23:10,279
the jocky case and very recently in the

4379
03:23:10,279 --> 03:23:11,880
Sketcher

4380
03:23:11,880 --> 03:23:16,520
case um also the claim uh of public law

4381
03:23:16,520 --> 03:23:19,080
duties breach of public law duties as

4382
03:23:19,080 --> 03:23:21,279
discussed in par honey should also be

4383
03:23:21,279 --> 03:23:25,399
struck without uh without uh because it

4384
03:23:25,399 --> 03:23:27,920
was just simply rep repudiated by the

4385
03:23:27,920 --> 03:23:30,439
Supreme Court and this is pretty clear

4386
03:23:30,439 --> 03:23:32,319
from uh the case law we

4387
03:23:32,319 --> 03:23:35,840
submitted um the the claim in neg for

4388
03:23:35,840 --> 03:23:37,680
negligence should also be struck for the

4389
03:23:37,680 --> 03:23:40,239
reasons that I've set out mainly because

4390
03:23:40,239 --> 03:23:42,600
there can be no uh relationship of

4391
03:23:42,600 --> 03:23:45,279
proximity it would run contrary to the

4392
03:23:45,279 --> 03:23:48,000
purpose and of the act in the the

4393
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:50,319
provisions of the act it would also run

4394
03:23:50,319 --> 03:23:52,760
Contra it would also

4395
03:23:52,760 --> 03:23:54,319
um

4396
03:23:54,319 --> 03:23:56,120
uh

4397
03:23:56,120 --> 03:23:59,960
it yeah the the the cbsa was acting as a

4398
03:23:59,960 --> 03:24:02,560
duty as a auditor and a duty collector

4399
03:24:02,560 --> 03:24:06,199
in this case um and so

4400
03:24:06,199 --> 03:24:09,840
um even at the second stage there are

4401
03:24:09,840 --> 03:24:11,720
two strong policy considerations that

4402
03:24:11,720 --> 03:24:14,000
would still negate a duty of care I've

4403
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:15,600
told you what they are and determinate

4404
03:24:15,600 --> 03:24:18,920
liability and cir the circumvention of

4405
03:24:18,920 --> 03:24:22,600
the regime of the appeal scheme to the

4406
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:25,760
CIT um and the other heads of Damages

4407
03:24:25,760 --> 03:24:27,600
are also improper for the reasons that

4408
03:24:27,600 --> 03:24:30,279
I've set out I won't repeat them again

4409
03:24:30,279 --> 03:24:32,160
so we ask that this court strikes the

4410
03:24:32,160 --> 03:24:35,960
portions that are listed in uh paragraph

4411
03:24:35,960 --> 03:24:40,680
101 I of uh of our

4412
03:24:40,680 --> 03:24:44,239
factum um and in any event uh whatever

4413
03:24:44,239 --> 03:24:47,239
the outcome of this motion is we ask uh

4414
03:24:47,239 --> 03:24:50,080
for this court to provide um the

4415
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:53,840
defendant with uh 30 days at least to uh

4416
03:24:53,840 --> 03:24:57,239
to file an amended statement of defense

4417
03:24:57,239 --> 03:24:59,560
and of course uh as we stated we would

4418
03:24:59,560 --> 03:25:02,239
ask for our cost in this proceeding

4419
03:25:02,239 --> 03:25:07,000
minus uh the um the thrown away cost uh

4420
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:10,040
that the court will

4421
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:13,880
determine just do you not take the

4422
03:25:13,880 --> 03:25:16,120
position and correct me if I'm wrong

4423
03:25:16,120 --> 03:25:18,439
that the amended statement of claim

4424
03:25:18,439 --> 03:25:22,840
actually doesn't Advance a position

4425
03:25:22,840 --> 03:25:28,199
on the non-compliance issue pursuant

4426
03:25:28,199 --> 03:25:31,399
to section 135 of the Customs Act is is

4427
03:25:31,399 --> 03:25:34,160
that not a submission that you

4428
03:25:34,160 --> 03:25:36,399
make

4429
03:25:36,399 --> 03:25:38,319
um

4430
03:25:38,319 --> 03:25:41,680
well than if we if you go into the

4431
03:25:41,680 --> 03:25:44,800
amended statement of claim uh there's no

4432
03:25:44,800 --> 03:25:47,520
explicit uh the the plaintiff does not

4433
03:25:47,520 --> 03:25:50,080
explicitly ask this court to to find

4434
03:25:50,080 --> 03:25:52,680
that it did not contravene the act of

4435
03:25:52,680 --> 03:25:55,439
course there's portions of the there's

4436
03:25:55,439 --> 03:25:57,920
some allegations that actually speak to

4437
03:25:57,920 --> 03:26:01,040
uh the reason to believe issue and if uh

4438
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:03,920
so the whole Contra everything so some

4439
03:26:03,920 --> 03:26:05,600
of the allegations relate to the

4440
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:08,600
contravention of section

4441
03:26:08,600 --> 03:26:12,239
32.2 but um they the plaintiff doesn't

4442
03:26:12,239 --> 03:26:15,720
ask anywhere to overturn that uh that uh

4443
03:26:15,720 --> 03:26:18,080
the minister decision which should be

4444
03:26:18,080 --> 03:26:21,800
the focus of a section 135 action so

4445
03:26:21,800 --> 03:26:24,760
maybe I did not respond to your question

4446
03:26:24,760 --> 03:26:27,439
but uh please tell me if you no you

4447
03:26:27,439 --> 03:26:29,479
you've responded to my question but but

4448
03:26:29,479 --> 03:26:32,040
that links back to your position that uh

4449
03:26:32,040 --> 03:26:34,319
regardless of what happens here if any

4450
03:26:34,319 --> 03:26:36,560
of this is struck your position is it it

4451
03:26:36,560 --> 03:26:39,279
be struck without without any leave to

4452
03:26:39,279 --> 03:26:42,520
amend does that extend to to this issue

4453
03:26:42,520 --> 03:26:45,279
of the of what your position is is the

4454
03:26:45,279 --> 03:26:46,720
appropriate matter before of the court

4455
03:26:46,720 --> 03:26:49,040
on uh on Section

4456
03:26:49,040 --> 03:26:54,520
135 in compliance could B yeah they they

4457
03:26:54,520 --> 03:26:57,439
could amend on that so yeah I think so

4458
03:26:57,439 --> 03:26:59,040
so you're not opposed to an amendment on

4459
03:26:59,040 --> 03:27:00,239
those

4460
03:27:00,239 --> 03:27:02,600
grounds uh no we would have to see what

4461
03:27:02,600 --> 03:27:05,399
it would be but uh no because and also

4462
03:27:05,399 --> 03:27:08,319
because uh yeah it was not an issue

4463
03:27:08,319 --> 03:27:10,600
brought to us either

4464
03:27:10,600 --> 03:27:14,600
so yeah

4465
03:27:20,239 --> 03:27:22,359
all right thank you very much Mr Mayor

4466
03:27:22,359 --> 03:27:25,720

honor and and I I was going to rise in

4472
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:40,000
any event because we do have some

4473
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:44,399
concerns on timing uh and um but Mr

4474
03:27:44,399 --> 03:27:47,399
trevisano and I have have divided the

4475
03:27:47,399 --> 03:27:50,640
argument I intend briefly and and I'll

4476
03:27:50,640 --> 03:27:52,680
do this when we come back I will be

4477
03:27:52,680 --> 03:27:54,840
addressing the cause of action in

4478
03:27:54,840 --> 03:27:56,760
negligence and the Public

4479
03:27:56,760 --> 03:27:58,800
maladministration Public Law cause of

4480
03:27:58,800 --> 03:28:01,520
action which such as it's been described

4481
03:28:01,520 --> 03:28:05,040
I will also uh uh reply or respond to my

4482
03:28:05,040 --> 03:28:07,439
friend Mr Myer's arguments about

4483
03:28:07,439 --> 03:28:11,120
proximity and duty of care and um we'll

4484
03:28:11,120 --> 03:28:15,199
deal briefly with the parody honey um

4485
03:28:15,199 --> 03:28:18,080
seeli if if I can call it that that Mr

4486
03:28:18,080 --> 03:28:20,279
nosb backin referred to in the city of

4487
03:28:20,279 --> 03:28:22,600
Nelson needless to say city of Nelson

4488
03:28:22,600 --> 03:28:24,199
and Mary we take a very different view

4489
03:28:24,199 --> 03:28:25,840
of what that case says as I'm sure

4490
03:28:25,840 --> 03:28:27,800
Justice Stratus would as well if he were

4491
03:28:27,800 --> 03:28:30,800
here um Mr triviso will then deal with a

4492
03:28:30,800 --> 03:28:33,199
number of other um of the points that

4493
03:28:33,199 --> 03:28:35,640
have been raised our initial estimate

4494
03:28:35,640 --> 03:28:37,720
had been that we would be about an hour

4495
03:28:37,720 --> 03:28:41,359
each uh hopefully uh and and in practice

4496
03:28:41,359 --> 03:28:43,399
that was what it was uh working out to

4497
03:28:43,399 --> 03:28:45,439
be it may be a little longer than that

4498
03:28:45,439 --> 03:28:47,359
and I I my friends have had about three

4499
03:28:47,359 --> 03:28:50,800
and a half hours uh and I just I'm I'm

4500
03:28:50,800 --> 03:28:53,399
bit concerned so uh I wanted to bring

4501
03:28:53,399 --> 03:28:55,439
that to the Court's attention as

4502
03:28:55,439 --> 03:28:59,520
well all right um so with that then if

4503
03:28:59,520 --> 03:29:01,279
we break until two o'clock is that going

4504
03:29:01,279 --> 03:29:03,080
to give everybody enough time to grab a

4505
03:29:03,080 --> 03:29:05,399
bite to eat and uh and something to

4506
03:29:05,399 --> 03:29:07,279
drink and have a bit of a health break

4507
03:29:07,279 --> 03:29:10,120
I'm seeing everybody nodding all right I

4508
03:29:10,120 --> 03:29:11,600
and I know your comments with respect to

4509
03:29:11,600 --> 03:29:13,720
time Mr bter certainly uh certainly

4510
03:29:13,720 --> 03:29:15,520
appreciate uh your position in that

4511
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:16,640
regard

4512
03:29:16,640 --> 03:29:19,040
and uh I can assure you we we'll let you

4513
03:29:19,040 --> 03:29:20,239
have the time you need to make your

4514
03:29:20,239 --> 03:29:22,560
submissions uh if you need if you need

4515
03:29:22,560 --> 03:29:24,399
equivalent time you'll certainly get it

4516
03:29:24,399 --> 03:29:26,279
thank you it's always just in in the

4517
03:29:26,279 --> 03:29:28,600
case of such a complex series of

4518
03:29:28,600 --> 03:29:31,520
arguments when we roll around to 4 4:30

4519
03:29:31,520 --> 03:29:33,000
and I don't have to tell you this

4520
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:36,120
Justice gleon 4430 it gets hard a to

4521
03:29:36,120 --> 03:29:38,359
speak sensibly B it must be hard to

4522
03:29:38,359 --> 03:29:41,399
receive sensibly uh so uh so two o'clock

4523
03:29:41,399 --> 03:29:43,199
would be excellent thank you we'll break

4524
03:29:43,199 --> 03:29:44,800
it to and if you have concerns in that

4525
03:29:44,800 --> 03:29:46,840
regard we can certainly look at uh

4526
03:29:46,840 --> 03:29:49,000
scheduling some time to uh to finish up

4527
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:51,239
arguments if that becomes necessary if

4528
03:29:51,239 --> 03:29:53,359
that concern exists I'm not that

4529
03:29:53,359 --> 03:29:55,720
concerned myself at this stage but uh

4530
03:29:55,720 --> 03:29:57,359
but there might be Merit to what you say

4531
03:29:57,359 --> 03:30:00,840

03:30:33,279 --> 03:30:35,160
uh before we really get going if I could

4546
03:30:35,160 --> 03:30:37,720
ask you to have ready to hand the motion

4547
03:30:37,720 --> 03:30:40,199
record of the plaintiff so Ron's motion

4548
03:30:40,199 --> 03:30:43,760
record have it yes Ron's book of

4549
03:30:43,760 --> 03:30:46,840
authorities yes a cop of the pleading

4550
03:30:46,840 --> 03:30:48,279
wherever you have it I know it's in

4551
03:30:48,279 --> 03:30:52,040
multiple places yes and uh I may um in

4552
03:30:52,040 --> 03:30:55,399
in response to Mr um Maher's arguments I

4553
03:30:55,399 --> 03:30:58,120
may make reference to in particular the

4554
03:30:58,120 --> 03:31:01,960
jco case which is tab 29 of of my

4555
03:31:01,960 --> 03:31:05,920
friend's um book of authorities but uh I

4556
03:31:05,920 --> 03:31:07,359
may also have to address some of the

4557
03:31:07,359 --> 03:31:08,520
others depending on the Court's

4558
03:31:08,520 --> 03:31:10,920
questions if you have any and I have all

4559
03:31:10,920 --> 03:31:12,359
of that material here it might take me a

4560
03:31:12,359 --> 03:31:14,479
little longer to to get into some of it

4561
03:31:14,479 --> 03:31:16,560
but uh but it's all here yeah you're

4562
03:31:16,560 --> 03:31:18,120
you're better than me if you're doing it

4563
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:21,600
with multiple screens because I find I'm

4564
03:31:21,600 --> 03:31:23,960
I I guess I own too many stocks in paper

4565
03:31:23,960 --> 03:31:26,239
companies or something but uh I'm using

4566
03:31:26,239 --> 03:31:28,000
a mix I've got the I've got the records

4567
03:31:28,000 --> 03:31:29,680
in in paper version because I find it

4568
03:31:29,680 --> 03:31:31,080
easier but the books of authority are

4569
03:31:31,080 --> 03:31:33,000
all electronic so there's a little bit

4570
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:35,520
of bouncing around for sure but well and

4571
03:31:35,520 --> 03:31:37,640
I I'll then give you uh unlike my

4572
03:31:37,640 --> 03:31:39,199
friends I'm going to concentrate on

4573
03:31:39,199 --> 03:31:41,160
three uh cases and I'll tell you which

4574
03:31:41,160 --> 03:31:42,680
tabs they are right away if you want to

4575
03:31:42,680 --> 03:31:44,760
open them I'll I'll be starting in

4576
03:31:44,760 --> 03:31:48,399
Imperial tobacco which is tab 12 I will

4577
03:31:48,399 --> 03:31:51,040
then uh proceed to parody honey which is

4578
03:31:51,040 --> 03:31:54,279
tab 11 and then I'll go to tesone which

4579
03:31:54,279 --> 03:31:56,520
I believe is tab

4580
03:31:56,520 --> 03:32:00,800
six uh yes I may make brief reference to

4581
03:32:00,800 --> 03:32:04,439
others but I'll I'll direct you there um

4582
03:32:04,439 --> 03:32:08,319
when we come great all right thank you

4583
03:32:08,319 --> 03:32:10,239
and thank you again for uh for taking a

4584
03:32:10,239 --> 03:32:13,760
shorter lunch U uh break let me then uh

4585
03:32:13,760 --> 03:32:15,479
just sketch out the division of labor

4586
03:32:15,479 --> 03:32:18,080
between myself and Mr trivis Arnell I'm

4587
03:32:18,080 --> 03:32:19,840
going to review the particular

4588
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:21,840
allegations of negligence against the

4589
03:32:21,840 --> 03:32:24,479
defendant including importantly

4590
03:32:24,479 --> 03:32:26,439
pleadings in respect of

4591
03:32:26,439 --> 03:32:29,239
proximity the duty of care and the

4592
03:32:29,239 --> 03:32:31,920
material facts that are alleged in the

4593
03:32:31,920 --> 03:32:33,880
statement of claim to support those

4594
03:32:33,880 --> 03:32:38,160
negligence claims I will then sketch the

4595
03:32:38,160 --> 03:32:41,319
separate distinct but you know adjacent

4596
03:32:41,319 --> 03:32:44,520
claim of public Mal Administration and

4597
03:32:44,520 --> 03:32:46,600
relate the pleadings in in respect of

4598
03:32:46,600 --> 03:32:48,439
that back to the material facts that are

4599
03:32:48,439 --> 03:32:50,239
alleged and indeed in in your

4600
03:32:50,239 --> 03:32:52,800
interactions with Mr M nosb and and

4601
03:32:52,800 --> 03:32:55,239
Maher it's clear you're you're quite uh

4602
03:32:55,239 --> 03:32:57,319
you're quite alert to the pleading so I

4603
03:32:57,319 --> 03:32:59,760
I don't think I need to I I won't

4604
03:32:59,760 --> 03:33:02,720
belabor them I'll briefly describe the

4605
03:33:02,720 --> 03:33:05,600
damages being sought in this action for

4606
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:07,720
in this action in negligence or public

4607
03:33:07,720 --> 03:33:09,520
maladministration I will relate I'm

4608
03:33:09,520 --> 03:33:12,239
going to address my friend Mr nsb's

4609
03:33:12,239 --> 03:33:14,600
Claim about Downstream damages indeed

4610
03:33:14,600 --> 03:33:16,880
General damages are are pleaded and

4611
03:33:16,880 --> 03:33:19,319
they're properly pleaded lost business

4612
03:33:19,319 --> 03:33:21,720
is properly pleaded and I will take you

4613
03:33:21,720 --> 03:33:24,760
there uh finally I will deal uh with my

4614
03:33:24,760 --> 03:33:26,840
friends uh submissions with respect to

4615
03:33:26,840 --> 03:33:28,680
the new Supreme Court of Canada case in

4616
03:33:28,680 --> 03:33:30,319
Mary and

4617
03:33:30,319 --> 03:33:33,640
Nelson uh and the parody honey obiter in

4618
03:33:33,640 --> 03:33:37,080
that case uh in in my respectful view uh

4619
03:33:37,080 --> 03:33:39,199
there there's a very different um

4620
03:33:39,199 --> 03:33:40,840
reading of that case a much fairer

4621
03:33:40,840 --> 03:33:43,000
reading which means that the case before

4622
03:33:43,000 --> 03:33:45,479
you today the case at bar must go

4623
03:33:45,479 --> 03:33:47,239
through to a trial should go through to

4624
03:33:47,239 --> 03:33:51,279
a trial Mr triviso is then going to deal

4625
03:33:51,279 --> 03:33:52,920
uh first of all with the issue of

4626
03:33:52,920 --> 03:33:55,279
jurisdiction jurisdiction is no longer

4627
03:33:55,279 --> 03:33:57,399
an issue he will say because Ronco has

4628
03:33:57,399 --> 03:34:00,359
agreed as you've seen uh to eliminate

4629
03:34:00,359 --> 03:34:03,520
the prayer for Relief at paragraph 1A

4630
03:34:03,520 --> 03:34:05,720
that puts this case on all fours with

4631
03:34:05,720 --> 03:34:09,560
the tazone facts uh tazone was a similar

4632
03:34:09,560 --> 03:34:11,800
case where the underlying decision uh

4633
03:34:11,800 --> 03:34:14,439
was not challenged but the damages were

4634
03:34:14,439 --> 03:34:17,640
sought uh Mr triviso will then deal with

4635
03:34:17,640 --> 03:34:21,160
the estoppel arguments that um that are

4636
03:34:21,160 --> 03:34:24,319
raised he will deal with uh the general

4637
03:34:24,319 --> 03:34:26,279
damages pleading and the professional

4638
03:34:26,279 --> 03:34:27,520
fees

4639
03:34:27,520 --> 03:34:30,000
pleading and with the argument with

4640
03:34:30,000 --> 03:34:32,199
respect to an unnecessary multiplicity

4641
03:34:32,199 --> 03:34:34,800
of proceedings which importantly would

4642
03:34:34,800 --> 03:34:37,720
deprive Ronco of any meaningful redress

4643
03:34:37,720 --> 03:34:40,080
for all of these defendants actions and

4644
03:34:40,080 --> 03:34:42,279
I'm sure my friend Mr triso will talk to

4645
03:34:42,279 --> 03:34:45,080
you also about tazone because that case

4646
03:34:45,080 --> 03:34:47,199
in our view is is very material to this

4647
03:34:47,199 --> 03:34:49,000
Court's

4648
03:34:49,000 --> 03:34:51,520
consideration uh finally the the

4649
03:34:51,520 --> 03:34:54,560
centrality of Reason to Believe In in

4650
03:34:54,560 --> 03:34:57,640
this whole case uh Mr triviso will will

4651
03:34:57,640 --> 03:34:58,800
touch

4652
03:34:58,800 --> 03:35:02,760
on so with that overview uh sir and if

4653
03:35:02,760 --> 03:35:04,439
there are no questions I think I would

4654
03:35:04,439 --> 03:35:05,160
just

4655
03:35:05,160 --> 03:35:08,279
start and please go go ahead since this

4656
03:35:08,279 --> 03:35:10,199
is a motion to strike and you did invite

4657
03:35:10,199 --> 03:35:12,720
my friends comments on the test I will

4658
03:35:12,720 --> 03:35:14,040
say there's there's fundamental

4659
03:35:14,040 --> 03:35:15,720
agreement and this court is very

4660
03:35:15,720 --> 03:35:17,359
familiar with the test for motions to

4661
03:35:17,359 --> 03:35:19,640
strike all of the allegations in a

4662
03:35:19,640 --> 03:35:22,560
pleading are taken to be true and my

4663
03:35:22,560 --> 03:35:24,960
friend didn't mention but I will stress

4664
03:35:24,960 --> 03:35:28,040
novelty of a cause of action is not a

4665
03:35:28,040 --> 03:35:31,000
reason to strike a claim uh justice

4666
03:35:31,000 --> 03:35:33,720
Stratus in the majority decision in

4667
03:35:33,720 --> 03:35:35,600
parody honey is very clear on that there

4668
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:37,199
are countless other cases that talk

4669
03:35:37,199 --> 03:35:39,760
about the novelty of a cause of action

4670
03:35:39,760 --> 03:35:42,920
and part of if you read the subtext of

4671
03:35:42,920 --> 03:35:47,080
my friend's plural arguments is uh well

4672
03:35:47,080 --> 03:35:49,399
this is novel it's Mr Maher said there's

4673
03:35:49,399 --> 03:35:52,319
never been a case where a duty where the

4674
03:35:52,319 --> 03:35:55,279
whether a duty of care is owed by cbsa

4675
03:35:55,279 --> 03:35:59,120
uh has um has has been found or has been

4676
03:35:59,120 --> 03:36:02,080
even considered this if it's novel that

4677
03:36:02,080 --> 03:36:04,359
is not a ground to strike in our in our

4678
03:36:04,359 --> 03:36:05,520
respectful

4679
03:36:05,520 --> 03:36:08,040
submissions but since it is a motion to

4680
03:36:08,040 --> 03:36:11,279
strike I'll use my my first observation

4681
03:36:11,279 --> 03:36:13,880
what is plain and obvious by now Justice

4682
03:36:13,880 --> 03:36:15,920
gleon is that the Attorney General does

4683
03:36:15,920 --> 03:36:18,640
not want this claim by Ronco to see the

4684
03:36:18,640 --> 03:36:19,880
light of

4685
03:36:19,880 --> 03:36:22,560
day that is plain and obvious if nothing

4686
03:36:22,560 --> 03:36:25,520
else is it seeks to immunize the conduct

4687
03:36:25,520 --> 03:36:28,640
of cbsa in that in its unilateral and

4688
03:36:28,640 --> 03:36:31,720
unfair imposition upon Ronco from any

4689
03:36:31,720 --> 03:36:34,479
realistic scrutiny by this

4690
03:36:34,479 --> 03:36:38,160
court and importantly very importantly

4691
03:36:38,160 --> 03:36:40,880
let there be no mistake it also seeks to

4692
03:36:40,880 --> 03:36:43,000
limit the materials that any of the

4693
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:45,199
three adjudicators that the defendant

4694
03:36:45,199 --> 03:36:47,600
proposed should adjudicate would have

4695
03:36:47,600 --> 03:36:50,800
before it it seeks to ensure there will

4696
03:36:50,800 --> 03:36:53,239
be no meaningful rights of Discovery

4697
03:36:53,239 --> 03:36:55,520
whether oral or written even though

4698
03:36:55,520 --> 03:36:58,040
we're here under an action we're here

4699
03:36:58,040 --> 03:37:01,199
under an action in the federal court it

4700
03:37:01,199 --> 03:37:04,120
it wants to limit uh the rights of

4701
03:37:04,120 --> 03:37:08,319
Discovery and it doesn't want uh to

4702
03:37:08,319 --> 03:37:11,680
allow the court whoever is deciding any

4703
03:37:11,680 --> 03:37:13,439
of the three adjudicators that my friend

4704
03:37:13,439 --> 03:37:16,800
is proposing the the federal court on Jr

4705
03:37:16,800 --> 03:37:19,279
the federal court on a trial or the

4706
03:37:19,279 --> 03:37:21,720
CIT to get to the bottom of the real

4707
03:37:21,720 --> 03:37:23,600
issue here and why is Discovery

4708
03:37:23,600 --> 03:37:26,080
important Justice gleon well some of the

4709
03:37:26,080 --> 03:37:29,800
pleadings make that clear on its face um

4710
03:37:29,800 --> 03:37:31,800
my

4711
03:37:31,800 --> 03:37:36,800
um why was Ronco submitted to this um

4712
03:37:36,800 --> 03:37:40,000
treatment when sumomo had the advanced

4713
03:37:40,000 --> 03:37:42,600
ruling certificate in its hand for 13

4714
03:37:42,600 --> 03:37:46,880
years what did cbsa say about this

4715
03:37:46,880 --> 03:37:49,760
treatment why did Doug band say what he

4716
03:37:49,760 --> 03:37:52,239
said when he was asked about it and

4717
03:37:52,239 --> 03:37:53,680
about reason to

4718
03:37:53,680 --> 03:37:56,880
believe why did the cbsa change its

4719
03:37:56,880 --> 03:38:00,600
practice after Ronco made a

4720
03:38:00,600 --> 03:38:03,800
fuss all of these things are relevant to

4721
03:38:03,800 --> 03:38:06,399
what is before this court and should not

4722
03:38:06,399 --> 03:38:09,279
with our in our respectful submission be

4723
03:38:09,279 --> 03:38:11,840
stricken on a motion to

4724
03:38:11,840 --> 03:38:14,160
strike and you will see uh from the

4725
03:38:14,160 --> 03:38:15,720
pleadings and will show you in the in

4726
03:38:15,720 --> 03:38:17,680
some of the materials that the

4727
03:38:17,680 --> 03:38:20,800
directions that Ronco gave as pardon me

4728
03:38:20,800 --> 03:38:24,840
that Ronco received that cbsa gave uh

4729
03:38:24,840 --> 03:38:26,319
this is how you vindicate your rights no

4730
03:38:26,319 --> 03:38:27,800
this is how you vindicate your rights no

4731
03:38:27,800 --> 03:38:29,120
actually it's over here you vindicate

4732
03:38:29,120 --> 03:38:30,680
your rights it reads like a game of

4733
03:38:30,680 --> 03:38:32,359
snakes and ladders I don't know if you

4734
03:38:32,359 --> 03:38:34,680
ever played Snakes and Ladders with your

4735
03:38:34,680 --> 03:38:37,840
children as or with your family it is

4736
03:38:37,840 --> 03:38:40,920
beyond doubt Justice gleon that at the

4737
03:38:40,920 --> 03:38:43,399
same time as starting this section 135

4738
03:38:43,399 --> 03:38:45,720
action Ronco could have commenced a

4739
03:38:45,720 --> 03:38:47,560
separate action in negligence and in

4740
03:38:47,560 --> 03:38:48,720
public law

4741
03:38:48,720 --> 03:38:50,520
maladministration and we wouldn't be

4742
03:38:50,520 --> 03:38:52,560
having this dispute about what you can

4743
03:38:52,560 --> 03:38:54,920
and can't do under a section

4744
03:38:54,920 --> 03:38:59,160
135 U action now Mr nosb and says well

4745
03:38:59,160 --> 03:39:00,840
we weren't opposed to the Amendments

4746
03:39:00,840 --> 03:39:02,760
because we thought ronow was going to

4747
03:39:02,760 --> 03:39:06,960
pursue the section 135 action uh and and

4748
03:39:06,960 --> 03:39:10,600
conclude it why one might ask would

4749
03:39:10,600 --> 03:39:13,600
anyone in their right mind pursue an

4750
03:39:13,600 --> 03:39:17,120
action the net result of which is to get

4751
03:39:17,120 --> 03:39:20,080
$1,000 of penalties

4752
03:39:20,080 --> 03:39:22,800
refunded it it's somewhat hard to

4753
03:39:22,800 --> 03:39:24,520
believe to hear the Attorney General say

4754
03:39:24,520 --> 03:39:26,319
that that's really what they believed

4755
03:39:26,319 --> 03:39:29,120
ronow was going to be

4756
03:39:29,120 --> 03:39:32,359
doing Ronco was told to go by way of

4757
03:39:32,359 --> 03:39:35,160
section 135 and my friend Mr triviso

4758
03:39:35,160 --> 03:39:36,760
will take you to those various

4759
03:39:36,760 --> 03:39:38,760
directions the only reason in other

4760
03:39:38,760 --> 03:39:41,040
words this is Brad under a section

4761
03:39:41,040 --> 03:39:44,439
135 um label if you want to call it that

4762
03:39:44,439 --> 03:39:47,279
way is it was told to do so but in all

4763
03:39:47,279 --> 03:39:50,040
of these uh three adjudicative scenarios

4764
03:39:50,040 --> 03:39:52,600
that my friend urge upon urge upon the

4765
03:39:52,600 --> 03:39:55,199
court reason to believe is Central

4766
03:39:55,199 --> 03:39:56,880
notwithstanding so obviously we take

4767
03:39:56,880 --> 03:40:00,479
issue with what Mr NSB and said in this

4768
03:40:00,479 --> 03:40:02,840
rearic but the intention of directing

4769
03:40:02,840 --> 03:40:05,920
Ron go to three different places is to

4770
03:40:05,920 --> 03:40:08,439
frustrate it in its attempts to get any

4771
03:40:08,439 --> 03:40:11,800
meaningful redress from from these

4772
03:40:11,800 --> 03:40:14,920
actions which in in the course of 13

4773
03:40:14,920 --> 03:40:17,760
years singled out one importer in an

4774
03:40:17,760 --> 03:40:20,199
industry of eight or nine importers and

4775
03:40:20,199 --> 03:40:20,920
it

4776
03:40:20,920 --> 03:40:23,840
alone and this is also in the context as

4777
03:40:23,840 --> 03:40:26,000
you as you're well aware where it gave

4778
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:28,960
an Express written Assurance to its main

4779
03:40:28,960 --> 03:40:30,720
to one of its main competitors sumat

4780
03:40:30,720 --> 03:40:33,439
Tomo that tariff 21 importer

4781
03:40:33,439 --> 03:40:36,080
importations were appropriate that that

4782
03:40:36,080 --> 03:40:38,920
was the just and appropriate one to

4783
03:40:38,920 --> 03:40:41,640
use you might be asking yourself at this

4784
03:40:41,640 --> 03:40:43,239
stage well he says reason to believe is

4785
03:40:43,239 --> 03:40:46,120
important too how can reason to believe

4786
03:40:46,120 --> 03:40:47,520
and the assertion that Ronco had a

4787
03:40:47,520 --> 03:40:49,399
reason to believe and that's why it

4788
03:40:49,399 --> 03:40:52,800
needs to pay four years in back duties

4789
03:40:52,800 --> 03:40:55,359
coexist with an Express written

4790
03:40:55,359 --> 03:40:59,080
Assurance to a competitor of the exact

4791
03:40:59,080 --> 03:41:01,640
opposite and it's also Justice gleon

4792
03:41:01,640 --> 03:41:04,199
against the backdrop this whole this

4793
03:41:04,199 --> 03:41:06,960
whole motion to strike where um the

4794
03:41:06,960 --> 03:41:08,920
defendant through the privy Council and

4795
03:41:08,920 --> 03:41:11,080
the Minister of Finance has actually

4796
03:41:11,080 --> 03:41:13,920
decided to amend tariff 21 to make it

4797
03:41:13,920 --> 03:41:17,000
clear had it not been clear before that

4798
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:19,760
Ron's importation of the steel wheels as

4799
03:41:19,760 --> 03:41:22,520
a duty-free item was in fact proper and

4800
03:41:22,520 --> 03:41:24,520
appropriate and so the first thing I'd

4801
03:41:24,520 --> 03:41:28,000
ask you to turn up if I could is tab

4802
03:41:28,000 --> 03:41:32,760
I of the motion record of

4803
03:41:32,800 --> 03:41:35,520
Ronco and if you're if you have it in

4804
03:41:35,520 --> 03:41:38,359
paper so it's tab I and it's record page

4805
03:41:38,359 --> 03:41:42,040
I'll start at record page 108 just for

4806
03:41:42,040 --> 03:41:44,880
completion I have it yes yes so that's

4807
03:41:44,880 --> 03:41:47,279
the uh the privy Council seal there and

4808
03:41:47,279 --> 03:41:50,680
you have the the date of April 23rd I

4809
03:41:50,680 --> 03:41:52,640
was I was scratching my head as to why

4810
03:41:52,640 --> 03:41:54,640
this wasn't U anyway it's not in the

4811
03:41:54,640 --> 03:41:56,880
pleadings but it is before you today if

4812
03:41:56,880 --> 03:41:59,239
you turn over now to record page 110

4813
03:41:59,239 --> 03:42:00,680
Justice

4814
03:42:00,680 --> 03:42:04,560
gleon and the amendment paragraph two

4815
03:42:04,560 --> 03:42:06,439
the list of tariff Provisions set out in

4816
03:42:06,439 --> 03:42:08,120
the schedule to the ACT is amended as

4817
03:42:08,120 --> 03:42:09,640
set out in part one of the schedule to

4818
03:42:09,640 --> 03:42:12,920
this order next page record page

4819
03:42:12,920 --> 03:42:16,199
111 uh paragraph 1B the description of

4820
03:42:16,199 --> 03:42:18,880
goods of tariff item I'll call it tariff

4821
03:42:18,880 --> 03:42:20,520
21 that's the language we use in the

4822
03:42:20,520 --> 03:42:24,000
pleading is amended by adding forg for

4823
03:42:24,000 --> 03:42:25,760
use in the manufacturer production of

4824
03:42:25,760 --> 03:42:27,920
Wheel sets as a separate provision after

4825
03:42:27,920 --> 03:42:30,439
the provision referred to in paragraph

4826
03:42:30,439 --> 03:42:33,279
a well that's precisely what these

4827
03:42:33,279 --> 03:42:35,600
wheels as you've seen in the pleadings

4828
03:42:35,600 --> 03:42:38,880
are and always have been used for and

4829
03:42:38,880 --> 03:42:41,720
that's what that's precisely what

4830
03:42:41,720 --> 03:42:46,000
sumomo uh had an Express clearance to do

4831
03:42:46,000 --> 03:42:48,279
under tariff 21 for more than a decade

4832
03:42:48,279 --> 03:42:50,040
for 13 and a half

4833
03:42:50,040 --> 03:42:52,479
years as pleaded and the pleadings are

4834
03:42:52,479 --> 03:42:54,640
presumed true no other industry

4835
03:42:54,640 --> 03:42:56,960
participants were similarly penalized

4836
03:42:56,960 --> 03:42:58,840
and I'm going to deal with Mr Maher's

4837
03:42:58,840 --> 03:43:00,960
straw man argument if I may characterize

4838
03:43:00,960 --> 03:43:05,560
it so that we're requiring uh cbsa to uh

4839
03:43:05,560 --> 03:43:07,760
to verify every importation of every

4840
03:43:07,760 --> 03:43:09,720
adjud of every importer I'll come back

4841
03:43:09,720 --> 03:43:13,120
to that later but in this very limited

4842
03:43:13,120 --> 03:43:16,600
industry of eight participants

4843
03:43:16,600 --> 03:43:19,680
sumomo had express provision to do so

4844
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:23,920
and knowingly as it is pleaded um uh was

4845
03:43:23,920 --> 03:43:26,720
importing under tariff 21 whereas Ronco

4846
03:43:26,720 --> 03:43:29,520
was sub was subjected to this to this

4847
03:43:29,520 --> 03:43:30,880
conduct that's pleaded in the in the

4848
03:43:30,880 --> 03:43:33,239
statement of claim the Attorney General

4849
03:43:33,239 --> 03:43:36,040
now here today says it doesn't matter

4850
03:43:36,040 --> 03:43:38,080
you cannot pursue damages whether in

4851
03:43:38,080 --> 03:43:40,399
negligence or public law or any other

4852
03:43:40,399 --> 03:43:43,600
form and uh you you can't get meaningful

4853
03:43:43,600 --> 03:43:46,399
redress for this cont cond and I thought

4854
03:43:46,399 --> 03:43:48,680
it was significant for you to understand

4855
03:43:48,680 --> 03:43:51,120
where we are today the only the only

4856
03:43:51,120 --> 03:43:54,239
importer the only player in this whole

4857
03:43:54,239 --> 03:43:56,760
um in this whole picture that has been

4858
03:43:56,760 --> 03:43:59,479
subjected to this is

4859
03:43:59,479 --> 03:44:02,000
Ronco let me just stop you there quickly

4860
03:44:02,000 --> 03:44:04,399
Mr Baxter and one make sure I understand

4861
03:44:04,399 --> 03:44:09,239
the significance of of uh of tab I to

4862
03:44:09,239 --> 03:44:13,159
your record is is is this amendment now

4863
03:44:13,159 --> 03:44:15,640
bring these Wheel sets Within the scope

4864
03:44:15,640 --> 03:44:18,080
of the the Tariff 21 item is that is

4865
03:44:18,080 --> 03:44:20,319
that what the significance of this is

4866
03:44:20,319 --> 03:44:22,920
well our our position was it was

4867
03:44:22,920 --> 03:44:26,960
properly done so before indeed cbsa has

4868
03:44:26,960 --> 03:44:29,319
had told sumomo that was proper the

4869
03:44:29,319 --> 03:44:31,319
entire industry you'll see reference to

4870
03:44:31,319 --> 03:44:34,520
the DA statistics Canada data the entire

4871
03:44:34,520 --> 03:44:38,080
industry was doing so but for greater

4872
03:44:38,080 --> 03:44:40,040
Clarity the governor and Council has

4873
03:44:40,040 --> 03:44:42,640
said in case it wasn't clear

4874
03:44:42,640 --> 03:44:45,159
before it's now clear and that's what

4875
03:44:45,159 --> 03:44:47,920
that sub paragraph B that I that I read

4876
03:44:47,920 --> 03:44:50,239
to you was does that does that help is

4877
03:44:50,239 --> 03:44:51,560
that answering your question I think so

4878
03:44:51,560 --> 03:44:53,000
I think I think it does that's that's

4879
03:44:53,000 --> 03:44:55,040
fine and my second question is is really

4880
03:44:55,040 --> 03:44:57,840
the question I posed to to your friends

4881
03:44:57,840 --> 03:45:01,199
which is the advanced ruling that sumomo

4882
03:45:01,199 --> 03:45:04,239
was relying on was Ronco not in a

4883
03:45:04,239 --> 03:45:06,199
position to obtain a similar ruling

4884
03:45:06,199 --> 03:45:09,680
itself and is that relevant here again I

4885
03:45:09,680 --> 03:45:11,760
asked a question uh no no we don't

4886
03:45:11,760 --> 03:45:13,159
believe it's relevant to the negligence

4887
03:45:13,159 --> 03:45:15,080
claim and the public law claim at all

4888
03:45:15,080 --> 03:45:17,439
believe they were in a position to do so

4889
03:45:17,439 --> 03:45:19,920
I believe the the evidence at trial if

4890
03:45:19,920 --> 03:45:21,800
there is to be a trial justice gleon

4891
03:45:21,800 --> 03:45:25,080
inshah as we would say uh would uh would

4892
03:45:25,080 --> 03:45:27,359
uh will show that the entire industry

4893
03:45:27,359 --> 03:45:30,319
for more than a decade was using tariff

4894
03:45:30,319 --> 03:45:32,040
21 with

4895
03:45:32,040 --> 03:45:36,199
no absolutely no question that's that is

4896
03:45:36,199 --> 03:45:39,680
as is pleaded uh is what FedEx told but

4897
03:45:39,680 --> 03:45:42,000
was it open to them yes it was open so

4898
03:45:42,000 --> 03:45:43,920
my friend perhaps Mr Maher's argument

4899
03:45:43,920 --> 03:45:45,479
should best be and I was going to come

4900
03:45:45,479 --> 03:45:47,560
to that in response but should best be

4901
03:45:47,560 --> 03:45:50,040
understood as a contributory negligence

4902
03:45:50,040 --> 03:45:52,239
argument well if we were negligent in

4903
03:45:52,239 --> 03:45:53,640
treating you as we did you were

4904
03:45:53,640 --> 03:45:55,439
contributorily negligent for not getting

4905
03:45:55,439 --> 03:45:59,439
an arc that's a fair defense at trial

4906
03:45:59,439 --> 03:46:01,880
but it's not a defense here to knock it

4907
03:46:01,880 --> 03:46:04,120
out of the box to have it be dead in the

4908
03:46:04,120 --> 03:46:06,920
water in our respectful view does that

4909
03:46:06,920 --> 03:46:10,000
does that help that does thank

4910
03:46:10,000 --> 03:46:13,800
you so you've seen the Tariff Amendment

4911
03:46:13,800 --> 03:46:15,239
so let's talk about the claim in

4912
03:46:15,239 --> 03:46:17,319
negligence that is really the core

4913
03:46:17,319 --> 03:46:20,680
Central claim as I say it is it stands

4914
03:46:20,680 --> 03:46:23,720
alongside the public law claim but let's

4915
03:46:23,720 --> 03:46:25,800
if I could get you to talk about the

4916
03:46:25,800 --> 03:46:28,399
essential nature of this claim and to do

4917
03:46:28,399 --> 03:46:30,760
so we'll look at the Imperial tobacco

4918
03:46:30,760 --> 03:46:34,680
case which is a tab 12 as I told you and

4919
03:46:34,680 --> 03:46:38,000
this is of course the leading case of uh

4920
03:46:38,000 --> 03:46:40,239
from the Supreme Court of Canada on on

4921
03:46:40,239 --> 03:46:42,960
um Public Law negligence claims it's

4922
03:46:42,960 --> 03:46:45,760
unanimous Court by the Chief Justice

4923
03:46:45,760 --> 03:46:49,279
mlin and I'd also ask you to have open

4924
03:46:49,279 --> 03:46:51,840
uh this is where paper helps me it may

4925
03:46:51,840 --> 03:46:53,560
it may be harder for you if you got

4926
03:46:53,560 --> 03:46:56,080
several screens have opened the specific

4927
03:46:56,080 --> 03:46:57,439
pleading at

4928
03:46:57,439 --> 03:47:00,279
paragraphs uh 61 to

4929
03:47:00,279 --> 03:47:02,760
66 because my friend did take you to

4930
03:47:02,760 --> 03:47:04,760
some of these but I think they bear some

4931
03:47:04,760 --> 03:47:09,920
more uh some more study if I

4932
03:47:09,920 --> 03:47:13,359
could give me a moment

4933
03:47:13,359 --> 03:47:16,960
here okay I have all of that material

4934
03:47:16,960 --> 03:47:19,159
okay so where I will start then is at

4935
03:47:19,159 --> 03:47:23,120
paragraph 39 of the decision of Justice

4936
03:47:23,120 --> 03:47:26,399
mcglaughlin in Imperial tobacco so this

4937
03:47:26,399 --> 03:47:28,960
is this is sort of the uh the Bible on

4938
03:47:28,960 --> 03:47:30,560
claims and negligence against public

4939
03:47:30,560 --> 03:47:32,960
authorities paragraph 39 is just setting

4940
03:47:32,960 --> 03:47:36,319
out the basic negligence test oh Mr

4941
03:47:36,319 --> 03:47:39,159
Maher

4942
03:47:39,159 --> 03:47:41,359
oh is he

4943
03:47:41,359 --> 03:47:43,560
having you're you're muted if you're

4944
03:47:43,560 --> 03:47:46,840
trying to talk to the court

4945
03:47:50,600 --> 03:47:54,040
is there an issue on uh on the defendant

4946
03:47:54,040 --> 03:47:57,399
side no so we okay we were just looking

4947
03:47:57,399 --> 03:48:00,159
for the the papers I thought understood

4948
03:48:00,159 --> 03:48:02,080
okay all right okay

4949
03:48:02,080 --> 03:48:04,840
sorry sorry I thought my friend had a

4950
03:48:04,840 --> 03:48:07,920
comment yeah go ahead Mr if you're with

4951
03:48:07,920 --> 03:48:10,960
me uh Justice gleon at paragraph 39

4952
03:48:10,960 --> 03:48:13,159
that's where Justice mlin on behalf of

4953
03:48:13,159 --> 03:48:15,359
the unanimous Court sets up the

4954
03:48:15,359 --> 03:48:17,439
discussion that's about to come and of

4955
03:48:17,439 --> 03:48:19,439
course my friends have talked about uh

4956
03:48:19,439 --> 03:48:22,279
proximity and a duty of care uh the

4957
03:48:22,279 --> 03:48:24,920
two-stage analysis is there and

4958
03:48:24,920 --> 03:48:28,279
essentially what my friends uh what my

4959
03:48:28,279 --> 03:48:31,199
friends focused on was the first

4960
03:48:31,199 --> 03:48:36,120
stage so let's look first with this with

4961
03:48:36,120 --> 03:48:39,920
this in mind at the specific pleading of

4962
03:48:39,920 --> 03:48:42,960
negligence that's before you today sir

4963
03:48:42,960 --> 03:48:45,199
and you have it

4964
03:48:45,199 --> 03:48:47,359
paragraph 61 of the statement of

4965
03:48:47,359 --> 03:48:51,159
claim cbsa owes a duty of care to Ronco

4966
03:48:51,159 --> 03:48:53,080
arising

4967
03:48:53,080 --> 03:48:55,520
from a role in administering and

4968
03:48:55,520 --> 03:48:58,920
enforcing the Customs act it's a role in

4969
03:48:58,920 --> 03:49:00,479
administering and enforcing its own

4970
03:49:00,479 --> 03:49:03,520
internal policies including the policies

4971
03:49:03,520 --> 03:49:06,319
noted I'm going to skip over C because

4972
03:49:06,319 --> 03:49:08,760
my friend uh there was another there was

4973
03:49:08,760 --> 03:49:10,920
another straw man if I may say about C

4974
03:49:10,920 --> 03:49:14,920
for a second uh D cbsa conduct and allow

4975
03:49:14,920 --> 03:49:16,840
other importers to import identical or

4976
03:49:16,840 --> 03:49:19,399
substantially similar Goods under tariff

4977
03:49:19,399 --> 03:49:22,840
21 e and e will be important cbsa

4978
03:49:22,840 --> 03:49:24,560
knowledge that Ronco and the industry as

4979
03:49:24,560 --> 03:49:26,439
a whole believe that tariff 21 was

4980
03:49:26,439 --> 03:49:28,880
correct and appropriate classification

4981
03:49:28,880 --> 03:49:30,319
for these imported

4982
03:49:30,319 --> 03:49:33,279
goods and F cbsa is knowledge that

4983
03:49:33,279 --> 03:49:34,920
treating Ronco differently from the rest

4984
03:49:34,920 --> 03:49:36,880
of the industry would cause significant

4985
03:49:36,880 --> 03:49:41,560
harm we say these are the prox these are

4986
03:49:41,560 --> 03:49:44,120
the factors of proximity which give rise

4987
03:49:44,120 --> 03:49:46,720
to the duty of

4988
03:49:46,720 --> 03:49:49,680
care and in paragraph

4989
03:49:49,680 --> 03:49:52,199
63 and I won't read them all because I'm

4990
03:49:52,199 --> 03:49:54,080
sure you've read them a number of times

4991
03:49:54,080 --> 03:49:56,319
we say what the content of that duty of

4992
03:49:56,319 --> 03:49:57,319
care

4993
03:49:57,319 --> 03:49:59,600
is and when I come back to whether

4994
03:49:59,600 --> 03:50:02,040
there's a policy reason to negate the

4995
03:50:02,040 --> 03:50:05,159
content of that we may look at these in

4996
03:50:05,159 --> 03:50:07,880
Greater

4997
03:50:11,600 --> 03:50:16,120
detail so the dis

4998
03:50:16,279 --> 03:50:18,720
the discussion by Justice mcglaughlin of

4999
03:50:18,720 --> 03:50:21,439
these factors really starts at paragraph

5000
03:50:21,439 --> 03:50:25,439
41 and uh but where I think I will uh

5001
03:50:25,439 --> 03:50:28,399
and I commend this entire section of uh

5002
03:50:28,399 --> 03:50:30,199
Imperial tobacco to your reading and

5003
03:50:30,199 --> 03:50:31,600
rereading as I'm sure you've done

5004
03:50:31,600 --> 03:50:33,800
already a hundred times but let's go to

5005
03:50:33,800 --> 03:50:36,640
paragraph 43 together if we could

5006
03:50:36,640 --> 03:50:40,239
because this is where she sketches out

5007
03:50:40,239 --> 03:50:41,880
the two types of

5008
03:50:41,880 --> 03:50:45,279
negligence um claims

5009
03:50:45,279 --> 03:50:47,120
and I'll I'll read from the the third

5010
03:50:47,120 --> 03:50:49,920
line two situations may be distinguished

5011
03:50:49,920 --> 03:50:51,399
the first is a situation where the

5012
03:50:51,399 --> 03:50:53,439
alleged duty of care is said to arise

5013
03:50:53,439 --> 03:50:55,120
explicitly or by implication from the

5014
03:50:55,120 --> 03:50:57,600
statutory scheme the second is a

5015
03:50:57,600 --> 03:50:59,040
situation where the duty of care is

5016
03:50:59,040 --> 03:51:01,199
alleged to arise from interactions

5017
03:51:01,199 --> 03:51:02,840
between the claimant and the government

5018
03:51:02,840 --> 03:51:05,279
and is not negated by the

5019
03:51:05,279 --> 03:51:06,960
statute

5020
03:51:06,960 --> 03:51:09,800
so uh the next paragraph she talks about

5021
03:51:09,800 --> 03:51:12,920
the statutory scheme and of course as I

5022
03:51:12,920 --> 03:51:15,040
just showed you Ronco has pleaded that

5023
03:51:15,040 --> 03:51:17,680
Ronco has pleaded the statutory scheme

5024
03:51:17,680 --> 03:51:21,040
duty of care in 61a and

5025
03:51:21,040 --> 03:51:23,800
61b and in our submissions that is

5026
03:51:23,800 --> 03:51:25,600
properly

5027
03:51:25,600 --> 03:51:28,920
pleaded but paragraph 45 talks about the

5028
03:51:28,920 --> 03:51:32,080
second class in category and these are

5029
03:51:32,080 --> 03:51:34,960
very important on this motion the second

5030
03:51:34,960 --> 03:51:36,520
situation is where the proximity

5031
03:51:36,520 --> 03:51:38,159
essential to the private duty of care is

5032
03:51:38,159 --> 03:51:40,159
alleged to arise from a series of

5033
03:51:40,159 --> 03:51:42,279
specific interactions between the

5034
03:51:42,279 --> 03:51:43,520
government and the

5035
03:51:43,520 --> 03:51:45,920
claimant the argument in those cases is

5036
03:51:45,920 --> 03:51:47,760
that the government has through its

5037
03:51:47,760 --> 03:51:49,840
conduct entered into a special

5038
03:51:49,840 --> 03:51:51,080
relationship with the plaintiff

5039
03:51:51,080 --> 03:51:52,880
sufficient to establish the necessary

5040
03:51:52,880 --> 03:51:55,239
proximity for a duty of care in these

5041
03:51:55,239 --> 03:51:57,080
cases the governing statutes are still

5042
03:51:57,080 --> 03:51:58,600
relevant to the

5043
03:51:58,600 --> 03:52:01,120
analysis for instance if a finding of

5044
03:52:01,120 --> 03:52:02,960
proximity would conflict with the

5045
03:52:02,960 --> 03:52:05,680
state's general public duty no Duty may

5046
03:52:05,680 --> 03:52:07,279
arise the court May hold that no

5047
03:52:07,279 --> 03:52:11,239
proximity arises well we have and Ronco

5048
03:52:11,239 --> 03:52:15,560
has pleaded precisely these types of

5049
03:52:15,560 --> 03:52:17,640
interactions and that's why I want to go

5050
03:52:17,640 --> 03:52:20,319
back to the pleading now and let's look

5051
03:52:20,319 --> 03:52:25,560
at paragraph 61 d e and

5052
03:52:25,560 --> 03:52:29,640
f 61d cbsa conduct in allowing other

5053
03:52:29,640 --> 03:52:31,279
importers to import identical or

5054
03:52:31,279 --> 03:52:33,600
substanti substantially similar Goods

5055
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:35,120
under tariff

5056
03:52:35,120 --> 03:52:39,279
21 61e cbsa is knowledge that Ronco and

5057
03:52:39,279 --> 03:52:41,520
the industry as a whole believed that

5058
03:52:41,520 --> 03:52:42,960
tariff 21 was the correct and

5059
03:52:42,960 --> 03:52:45,159
appropriate classification

5060
03:52:45,159 --> 03:52:47,800
F cbsa knowledge that treating Ronco

5061
03:52:47,800 --> 03:52:50,840
differently would harm it well these are

5062
03:52:50,840 --> 03:52:53,600
not just bald pleadings see my friend

5063
03:52:53,600 --> 03:52:55,479
did take you to these and In fairness to

5064
03:52:55,479 --> 03:52:57,800
him he was under a bit of time pressure

5065
03:52:57,800 --> 03:52:59,199
but I want to take you to the the

5066
03:52:59,199 --> 03:53:01,239
particulars of these pleadings and to do

5067
03:53:01,239 --> 03:53:03,439
so we'll go back to paragraph eight if I

5068
03:53:03,439 --> 03:53:07,279
could we'll start back at paragraph

5069
03:53:09,600 --> 03:53:12,920
eight paragraph eight is the sumomo

5070
03:53:12,920 --> 03:53:16,439
advanced ruling certificate

5071
03:53:16,640 --> 03:53:20,399
paragraph nine pleads the uh customs

5072
03:53:20,399 --> 03:53:23,560
broker advice but paragraphs 10 through

5073
03:53:23,560 --> 03:53:26,920
12 are the specific interactions that

5074
03:53:26,920 --> 03:53:28,920
are pleaded and these are taken to be

5075
03:53:28,920 --> 03:53:33,159
true your honor Ronco and sumomo and the

5076
03:53:33,159 --> 03:53:35,359
Canadian Railway and Customs Brokerage

5077
03:53:35,359 --> 03:53:37,880
industry as a whole understood and

5078
03:53:37,880 --> 03:53:39,800
reasonably believe that these wheels

5079
03:53:39,800 --> 03:53:41,520
were to be imported duty-free under this

5080
03:53:41,520 --> 03:53:45,359
tariff item cbsa own con conduct since

5081
03:53:45,359 --> 03:53:48,000
2005 confirmed and reinforced this

5082
03:53:48,000 --> 03:53:49,239
reasonable

5083
03:53:49,239 --> 03:53:52,760
belief this is in the context again

5084
03:53:52,760 --> 03:53:55,720
where it has issued an Express thumbs up

5085
03:53:55,720 --> 03:53:58,239
to sumomo in this

5086
03:53:58,239 --> 03:54:00,920
regard uh paragraph 11 talks about

5087
03:54:00,920 --> 03:54:02,960
similarly situated

5088
03:54:02,960 --> 03:54:05,600
importers without any importing under

5089
03:54:05,600 --> 03:54:08,159
tariff 21 without any Duty penalty or

5090
03:54:08,159 --> 03:54:09,600
enforcement

5091
03:54:09,600 --> 03:54:13,680
action and paragraph 12 cbsa knew or

5092
03:54:13,680 --> 03:54:15,319
ought to have known know that Ronco and

5093
03:54:15,319 --> 03:54:17,479
the industry as a whole believed the

5094
03:54:17,479 --> 03:54:20,399
Tariff 21 was a correct and appropriate

5095
03:54:20,399 --> 03:54:23,159
classification these are that is classic

5096
03:54:23,159 --> 03:54:24,520
if you want to put it that way

5097
03:54:24,520 --> 03:54:27,040
negligence language but let's turn again

5098
03:54:27,040 --> 03:54:31,000
to paragraph 42 because this is also a a

5099
03:54:31,000 --> 03:54:33,319
pleading that is true it happens to be

5100
03:54:33,319 --> 03:54:34,920
true but it's also presumed to be true

5101
03:54:34,920 --> 03:54:36,399
on this

5102
03:54:36,399 --> 03:54:39,640
motion industry Behavior also shows that

5103
03:54:39,640 --> 03:54:42,159
tariff 21 is not Prima fascia evident

5104
03:54:42,159 --> 03:54:44,760
and transparent as from the second part

5105
03:54:44,760 --> 03:54:47,439
of this as from 2005 to

5106
03:54:47,439 --> 03:54:50,760
2019 it was the cbsa own conduct that

5107
03:54:50,760 --> 03:54:53,439
drove importer Behavior rather than the

5108
03:54:53,439 --> 03:54:56,640
Tariff items wording which remained

5109
03:54:56,640 --> 03:54:59,239
unchanged this is going to come back of

5110
03:54:59,239 --> 03:55:02,640
course to the second class of negligence

5111
03:55:02,640 --> 03:55:05,319
pleading that Justice mcglaughlin talks

5112
03:55:05,319 --> 03:55:09,640
about but lest this court be concerned

5113
03:55:09,640 --> 03:55:11,720
that

5114
03:55:11,720 --> 03:55:14,640
I'm just

5115
03:55:14,640 --> 03:55:16,880
talking in the air about the validity of

5116
03:55:16,880 --> 03:55:19,199
the pleading in paragraph

5117
03:55:19,199 --> 03:55:22,600
42 my friend Mr nosb and took you to the

5118
03:55:22,600 --> 03:55:25,680
CIT notice of appeal and you don't need

5119
03:55:25,680 --> 03:55:27,680
to turn it up because it's a very short

5120
03:55:27,680 --> 03:55:29,279
but I will I will tell you where it is

5121
03:55:29,279 --> 03:55:33,080
it's a tab I as it happen same tab of

5122
03:55:33,080 --> 03:55:36,239
the of the defendant the Attorney

5123
03:55:36,239 --> 03:55:39,640
General's uh motion record and if you

5124
03:55:39,640 --> 03:55:41,439
have it if you have it in paper that's

5125
03:55:41,439 --> 03:55:45,120
great we'll go to record page 136

5126
03:55:45,120 --> 03:55:48,520
I have it go ahead um and it's just it's

5127
03:55:48,520 --> 03:55:50,760
the final four three lines there the

5128
03:55:50,760 --> 03:55:52,920
2005 Advanced ruling issue to Ron

5129
03:55:52,920 --> 03:55:55,159
foreign based competitor and statistics

5130
03:55:55,159 --> 03:55:57,760
Canada data regarding import Behavior

5131
03:55:57,760 --> 03:56:01,640
under tariff items 21 and 29 in that

5132
03:56:01,640 --> 03:56:02,439
time

5133
03:56:02,439 --> 03:56:06,640
period this data exists it was before

5134
03:56:06,640 --> 03:56:08,239
the president of the

5135
03:56:08,239 --> 03:56:10,920
cbsa it was be I believe it was even

5136
03:56:10,920 --> 03:56:14,359
before Mrs Ogie I'm not sure

5137
03:56:14,359 --> 03:56:17,040
so there is evidence in the world that

5138
03:56:17,040 --> 03:56:20,159
the cbsa knew first of all that it ought

5139
03:56:20,159 --> 03:56:22,840
to have known but that it knew that it's

5140
03:56:22,840 --> 03:56:26,159
that its own conduct influenced uh

5141
03:56:26,159 --> 03:56:29,040
importation of of these steel wheels

5142
03:56:29,040 --> 03:56:31,159
under tariff

5143
03:56:31,159 --> 03:56:35,199
21 I do this sir simply to situate this

5144
03:56:35,199 --> 03:56:37,520
pleading in the Juris Prudence of the

5145
03:56:37,520 --> 03:56:39,600
Supreme Court of

5146
03:56:39,600 --> 03:56:41,800
Canada so we are

5147
03:56:41,800 --> 03:56:44,439
back with me now we've talked talked

5148
03:56:44,439 --> 03:56:46,720
about this second class or category of

5149
03:56:46,720 --> 03:56:48,840
negligence pleading that Justice

5150
03:56:48,840 --> 03:56:53,279
McLaughlin has um has uh talked

5151
03:56:53,279 --> 03:56:55,920
about if you and I'll give you a time to

5152
03:56:55,920 --> 03:56:58,239
take a

5153
03:57:01,800 --> 03:57:04,920
note I'm now going back to paragraph 46

5154
03:57:04,920 --> 03:57:08,479
justice gleon of her decision finally it

5155
03:57:08,479 --> 03:57:10,560
is possible to Envision a claim where

5156
03:57:10,560 --> 03:57:13,040
proximity is based both on interactions

5157
03:57:13,040 --> 03:57:15,159
between the parties and a government

5158
03:57:15,159 --> 03:57:17,120
statutory duties well this is just such

5159
03:57:17,120 --> 03:57:19,520
a claim the one before you sir is just

5160
03:57:19,520 --> 03:57:21,279
such a claim and then let's look what

5161
03:57:21,279 --> 03:57:23,800
she says at paragraph

5162
03:57:23,800 --> 03:57:26,760
47 since this is a motion to strike the

5163
03:57:26,760 --> 03:57:28,680
questions before us is simply whether

5164
03:57:28,680 --> 03:57:30,680
assuming the facts pleaded to be true

5165
03:57:30,680 --> 03:57:32,640
there is any reasonable Prospect of

5166
03:57:32,640 --> 03:57:35,239
successfully establishing proximity on

5167
03:57:35,239 --> 03:57:37,880
the basis of a statute or otherwise on

5168
03:57:37,880 --> 03:57:39,880
the one hand where the sole basis

5169
03:57:39,880 --> 03:57:42,479
asserted for proximity is the statute

5170
03:57:42,479 --> 03:57:43,960
conflicting public duties May rule at

5171
03:57:43,960 --> 03:57:46,359
any possibility of proximity being

5172
03:57:46,359 --> 03:57:48,640
established on the other hand where the

5173
03:57:48,640 --> 03:57:50,520
asserted basis for proximity is grounded

5174
03:57:50,520 --> 03:57:53,000
in specific conduct and interactions

5175
03:57:53,000 --> 03:57:55,040
ruling a claim out at the proximity

5176
03:57:55,040 --> 03:57:57,439
stage may be difficult and then these

5177
03:57:57,439 --> 03:58:00,319
final five or six lines are crucial so

5178
03:58:00,319 --> 03:58:02,040
long as there is a reasonable prospect

5179
03:58:02,040 --> 03:58:04,040
that the asserted interactions could if

5180
03:58:04,040 --> 03:58:06,080
True Result in a finding a sufficient

5181
03:58:06,080 --> 03:58:08,479
proximity and the statute does not

5182
03:58:08,479 --> 03:58:10,800
exclude that possibility the matter must

5183
03:58:10,800 --> 03:58:13,920
be allowed to proceed to trial subject

5184
03:58:13,920 --> 03:58:16,680
to any policy considerations that may

5185
03:58:16,680 --> 03:58:19,439
negate uh the Prima fascia duty of Care

5186
03:58:19,439 --> 03:58:22,080
at the second

5187
03:58:22,640 --> 03:58:26,399
stage we submit that there is more than

5188
03:58:26,399 --> 03:58:28,399
a reasonable prospect that the asserted

5189
03:58:28,399 --> 03:58:31,359
interactions could be made out we assert

5190
03:58:31,359 --> 03:58:33,960
that we've there is evidence before you

5191
03:58:33,960 --> 03:58:36,800
today that these asserted interactions

5192
03:58:36,800 --> 03:58:38,840
happened I've shown you that there is

5193
03:58:38,840 --> 03:58:41,680
stats Canada evidence that was relied

5194
03:58:41,680 --> 03:58:43,239
upon it before the president will be

5195
03:58:43,239 --> 03:58:45,239
relied upon it at trial if if this

5196
03:58:45,239 --> 03:58:47,439
matter gets to a

5197
03:58:47,439 --> 03:58:51,319
trial the the the test that the Supreme

5198
03:58:51,319 --> 03:58:53,120
Court of Canada has enunciated for

5199
03:58:53,120 --> 03:58:54,760
whether a motion to Strike should

5200
03:58:54,760 --> 03:58:57,359
succeed is more than met by Ronco on

5201
03:58:57,359 --> 03:58:59,000
what's before you

5202
03:58:59,000 --> 03:59:04,560
today um so uh I've shown you the we can

5203
03:59:04,560 --> 03:59:06,040
actually take you to the advanced ruling

5204
03:59:06,040 --> 03:59:08,920
certificate but Mr Maher actually said

5205
03:59:08,920 --> 03:59:11,520
it's it's not in dispute the evidence

5206
03:59:11,520 --> 03:59:14,120
about the Imports it might be of a

5207
03:59:14,120 --> 03:59:16,600
assistance to you if you do have Ron's

5208
03:59:16,600 --> 03:59:18,080
motion record I'll just take you there

5209
03:59:18,080 --> 03:59:21,880
so you have it all it's a tab E Record

5210
03:59:21,880 --> 03:59:26,120
page 77 Justice

5211
03:59:27,080 --> 03:59:31,279
gleon page 77 did you say yeah 76 and 77

5212
03:59:31,279 --> 03:59:33,800
actually if you

5213
03:59:34,800 --> 03:59:40,159
want yes uh there at 76 on the leftand

5214
03:59:40,159 --> 03:59:42,880
side uh there is the evidence about

5215
03:59:42,880 --> 03:59:44,760
other uh

5216
03:59:44,760 --> 03:59:46,600
other importers into Canada it's

5217
03:59:46,600 --> 03:59:48,720
essentially a group of between eight and

5218
03:59:48,720 --> 03:59:50,399
10

5219
03:59:50,399 --> 03:59:53,720
importers okay and at top of page 77

5220
03:59:53,720 --> 03:59:55,520
given that so many industry participants

5221
03:59:55,520 --> 03:59:57,439
considered real bodies to be properly

5222
03:59:57,439 --> 03:59:59,520
classified under tariff item

5223
03:59:59,520 --> 04:00:02,439
21 this so this was sorry these are

5224
04:00:02,439 --> 04:00:05,000
submissions that were directed have to

5225
04:00:05,000 --> 04:00:07,720
remember which level this was directed

5226
04:00:07,720 --> 04:00:10,640
to this is probably to the the

5227
04:00:10,640 --> 04:00:13,399
ministerial pardon me the president's uh

5228
04:00:13,399 --> 04:00:15,960
appeal

5229
04:00:16,040 --> 04:00:19,439
um and then below there you have the

5230
04:00:19,439 --> 04:00:22,120
reference under subparagraph five on

5231
04:00:22,120 --> 04:00:25,600
page 77 to the sumomo Advance ruling and

5232
04:00:25,600 --> 04:00:27,399
you see in footnote

5233
04:00:27,399 --> 04:00:31,880
29 that that was uh before the

5234
04:00:31,880 --> 04:00:35,279
CIT uh so what is what why is this

5235
04:00:35,279 --> 04:00:37,520
helpful for you this is helpful for the

5236
04:00:37,520 --> 04:00:40,960
court in this uh instance Justice gleon

5237
04:00:40,960 --> 04:00:43,399
because the Supreme Court has said if

5238
04:00:43,399 --> 04:00:45,720
there's if there's a reasonable prospect

5239
04:00:45,720 --> 04:00:47,720
that the specific interactions can be

5240
04:00:47,720 --> 04:00:50,920
made out the matter should go to a trial

5241
04:00:50,920 --> 04:00:52,840
well in our submission there's more than

5242
04:00:52,840 --> 04:00:55,080
a reasonable Prospect you have some of

5243
04:00:55,080 --> 04:00:57,720
the evidence here before you

5244
04:00:57,720 --> 04:01:00,040
today the matter must be allowed to

5245
04:01:00,040 --> 04:01:03,159
proceed to trial of course subject to

5246
04:01:03,159 --> 04:01:05,000
any policy considerations that would

5247
04:01:05,000 --> 04:01:08,600
negate the duty of care now you in in

5248
04:01:08,600 --> 04:01:10,920
our view astutely and correctly ask Mr

5249
04:01:10,920 --> 04:01:12,640
Maher don't I need don't I need evidence

5250
04:01:12,640 --> 04:01:14,760
on policy consideration in our view of

5251
04:01:14,760 --> 04:01:16,880
course you do but it's hard to it's hard

5252
04:01:16,880 --> 04:01:18,239
to imagine what these policy

5253
04:01:18,239 --> 04:01:19,800
considerations should

5254
04:01:19,800 --> 04:01:23,560
be the duty of care that's alleged is to

5255
04:01:23,560 --> 04:01:26,000
apply the ACT fairly and consistently

5256
04:01:26,000 --> 04:01:27,040
between

5257
04:01:27,040 --> 04:01:28,840
importers there's nothing in the

5258
04:01:28,840 --> 04:01:32,120
legislative scheme so let's just think

5259
04:01:32,120 --> 04:01:34,239
about that apply the ACT fairly and

5260
04:01:34,239 --> 04:01:35,720
consistently between

5261
04:01:35,720 --> 04:01:37,399
importers there's nothing in the

5262
04:01:37,399 --> 04:01:39,680
legislative scheme and indeed there

5263
04:01:39,680 --> 04:01:41,319
never would be in legislative scheme

5264
04:01:41,319 --> 04:01:44,600
that would that would negate that Duty

5265
04:01:44,600 --> 04:01:46,760
so what would the policy consideration

5266
04:01:46,760 --> 04:01:50,600
be that would negate that uh to protect

5267
04:01:50,600 --> 04:01:53,479
unequal treatment of similarly situated

5268
04:01:53,479 --> 04:01:57,399
importers to protect uh to protect

5269
04:01:57,399 --> 04:01:59,439
giving an advanced ruling over here and

5270
04:01:59,439 --> 04:02:01,560
treating other people differently here

5271
04:02:01,560 --> 04:02:03,920
it's very hard to imagine a policy

5272
04:02:03,920 --> 04:02:06,640
consideration that would negate it and

5273
04:02:06,640 --> 04:02:08,760
with all due respect in an industry of

5274
04:02:08,760 --> 04:02:11,399
eight with with a very finite group of

5275
04:02:11,399 --> 04:02:12,640
Industry

5276
04:02:12,640 --> 04:02:16,319
participants the the Spectre of um

5277
04:02:16,319 --> 04:02:19,760
unlimited liability uh is is at best

5278
04:02:19,760 --> 04:02:22,040
speculative and of course this is this

5279
04:02:22,040 --> 04:02:24,120
is absolutely open to the attorney

5280
04:02:24,120 --> 04:02:27,880
general at a trial of this matter so we

5281
04:02:27,880 --> 04:02:31,199
say on the test in Imperial

5282
04:02:31,199 --> 04:02:34,920
tobacco the duty of care the proximity

5283
04:02:34,920 --> 04:02:37,640
required for duty of care the substance

5284
04:02:37,640 --> 04:02:39,640
of the duty of care and the breach of

5285
04:02:39,640 --> 04:02:42,399
the duty of care are properly pleaded

5286
04:02:42,399 --> 04:02:44,680
you have evidence here today

5287
04:02:44,680 --> 04:02:47,640
as to why Justice McLaughlin's test is

5288
04:02:47,640 --> 04:02:50,520
met both on the statutory and we say on

5289
04:02:50,520 --> 04:02:53,040
the specific interaction branch of that

5290
04:02:53,040 --> 04:02:55,800
test and it must be allowed to

5291
04:02:55,800 --> 04:02:58,680
proceed my friend's arguments if

5292
04:02:58,680 --> 04:03:02,159
accepted would immunize any reasonable

5293
04:03:02,159 --> 04:03:05,359
scrutiny of of these types of

5294
04:03:05,359 --> 04:03:08,439
activities now I do want to are there

5295
04:03:08,439 --> 04:03:10,760
any questions on the Imperial tobacco

5296
04:03:10,760 --> 04:03:12,359
case because there wasn't a lot more I

5297
04:03:12,359 --> 04:03:15,080
had to say on that sir no I think I

5298
04:03:15,080 --> 04:03:18,120
think the uh I think I've got the the

5299
04:03:18,120 --> 04:03:19,159
submission and the position you're

5300
04:03:19,159 --> 04:03:21,479
advancing yeah thank you yeah so just to

5301
04:03:21,479 --> 04:03:24,439
sum it up I guess from paragraphs 39 to

5302
04:03:24,439 --> 04:03:28,680
47 of the case are the key paragraphs uh

5303
04:03:28,680 --> 04:03:30,080
as they relate to the negligence

5304
04:03:30,080 --> 04:03:32,880
pleading in this

5305
04:03:33,040 --> 04:03:36,439
action uh at this stage I should deal

5306
04:03:36,439 --> 04:03:38,239
with my friend Mr

5307
04:03:38,239 --> 04:03:40,520
Maher's treatment of a couple of the

5308
04:03:40,520 --> 04:03:43,279
cases the main case that was relied upon

5309
04:03:43,279 --> 04:03:45,279
by the attorney general against this

5310
04:03:45,279 --> 04:03:48,960
duty of care is a case uh by Justice

5311
04:03:48,960 --> 04:03:51,199
Fred Meyer is of the Ontario Superior

5312
04:03:51,199 --> 04:03:54,199
Court a very experienced judge and it's

5313
04:03:54,199 --> 04:03:58,359
the jco case so if you have that it's a

5314
04:03:58,359 --> 04:04:01,760
a tab

5315
04:04:04,040 --> 04:04:06,920
29 and you'll recall that the argument

5316
04:04:06,920 --> 04:04:09,680
here was to

5317
04:04:09,680 --> 04:04:11,560
analogize sorry I'm just going to move

5318
04:04:11,560 --> 04:04:15,399
my books around a bit

5319
04:04:24,920 --> 04:04:27,120
the argument here Justice Leon was to

5320
04:04:27,120 --> 04:04:30,560
analogize the cbsa role to the cra's

5321
04:04:30,560 --> 04:04:32,880
role in a tax in a tax

5322
04:04:32,880 --> 04:04:38,239
matter and the uh the issue before uh

5323
04:04:38,239 --> 04:04:41,359
justice Meyers again it was uh it was

5324
04:04:41,359 --> 04:04:44,359
her majesty moving to strike a claim

5325
04:04:44,359 --> 04:04:46,000
uh it's a favorite activity of her

5326
04:04:46,000 --> 04:04:50,760
majesty it seems and um uh the issue

5327
04:04:50,760 --> 04:04:54,640
before them was whether in an audit

5328
04:04:54,640 --> 04:04:56,760
circumstance uh there's a duty of care

5329
04:04:56,760 --> 04:04:58,840
owed and and my friend did take you to

5330
04:04:58,840 --> 04:05:01,760
paragraph 26 so let's start there and he

5331
04:05:01,760 --> 04:05:04,120
says paragraph 26 of Justice

5332
04:05:04,120 --> 04:05:06,840
Meyers um the claim for negligence Fair

5333
04:05:06,840 --> 04:05:08,399
no better there's ample case law

5334
04:05:08,399 --> 04:05:12,800
rejecting the proximity okay and um he

5335
04:05:12,800 --> 04:05:15,080
then uh skipped by notes say right to

5336
04:05:15,080 --> 04:05:16,080
paragraph

5337
04:05:16,080 --> 04:05:20,840
33 which uh was was interesting because

5338
04:05:20,840 --> 04:05:23,479
some of the most important um portions

5339
04:05:23,479 --> 04:05:25,880
of Justice Meyers ruling follow

5340
04:05:25,880 --> 04:05:28,560
immediately after paragraph 26 if you

5341
04:05:28,560 --> 04:05:31,080
look at paragraph 29 of course in

5342
04:05:31,080 --> 04:05:33,680
paragraph 29 he's talking about an

5343
04:05:33,680 --> 04:05:37,319
outlier case this is called laru versus

5344
04:05:37,319 --> 04:05:40,080
Canada Revenue and it's from the BC

5345
04:05:40,080 --> 04:05:42,080
court of appeal and I commend this

5346
04:05:42,080 --> 04:05:44,000
entire case and particularly this

5347
04:05:44,000 --> 04:05:45,880
portion of it to your to your close

5348
04:05:45,880 --> 04:05:49,040
study I know you had 46 or 53

5349
04:05:49,040 --> 04:05:51,359
authorities from my friends so there's a

5350
04:05:51,359 --> 04:05:53,720
lot of reading and I uh but this this

5351
04:05:53,720 --> 04:05:56,239
this one really merits it because he's

5352
04:05:56,239 --> 04:05:59,600
talking about uh Hill in 27 you see he's

5353
04:05:59,600 --> 04:06:00,720
talking about Hill and Hamilton

5354
04:06:00,720 --> 04:06:02,040
Wentworth that's the Supreme Court of

5355
04:06:02,040 --> 04:06:04,920
Canada case which says essentially that

5356
04:06:04,920 --> 04:06:07,199
for an investigation there's a duty of

5357
04:06:07,199 --> 04:06:10,319
care that can be owed okay but now we go

5358
04:06:10,319 --> 04:06:12,239
and he's talking about this outlier case

5359
04:06:12,239 --> 04:06:16,080
laru 29 go over with me to paragraph 30

5360
04:06:16,080 --> 04:06:18,399
which where Justice Meyer is is doing as

5361
04:06:18,399 --> 04:06:20,479
he should do considering the court of

5362
04:06:20,479 --> 04:06:21,560
appeal from

5363
04:06:21,560 --> 04:06:25,640
Ontario's um treatment of that and this

5364
04:06:25,640 --> 04:06:28,279
is the difference uh between an audit

5365
04:06:28,279 --> 04:06:30,439
and an investigation that's the fact

5366
04:06:30,439 --> 04:06:32,399
situation that they found themselves in

5367
04:06:32,399 --> 04:06:36,080
in jco but here he notes in paragraph 30

5368
04:06:36,080 --> 04:06:37,840
the court of appeal from

5369
04:06:37,840 --> 04:06:40,800
Ontario's um uh consideration of the

5370
04:06:40,800 --> 04:06:44,840
laru case and uh I won't read it all to

5371
04:06:44,840 --> 04:06:47,760
you but if we get down to paragraph 62

5372
04:06:47,760 --> 04:06:51,960
of the cited MC McCrate case the court

5373
04:06:51,960 --> 04:06:55,439
of appeal has said uh whenever McCrate

5374
04:06:55,439 --> 04:06:58,000
was uh I don't know the year of

5375
04:06:58,000 --> 04:07:01,000
McCrate um it's obviously after 2012

5376
04:07:01,000 --> 04:07:03,520
however secondly I can see no relevant

5377
04:07:03,520 --> 04:07:05,560
distinction between the above cited case

5378
04:07:05,560 --> 04:07:09,760
of Laro and this case so he can see no

5379
04:07:09,760 --> 04:07:11,080
IR relevant

5380
04:07:11,080 --> 04:07:13,760
distinction between the British columb I

5381
04:07:13,760 --> 04:07:16,840
court of appeal which found a duty of

5382
04:07:16,840 --> 04:07:19,720
care in an audit

5383
04:07:19,720 --> 04:07:23,159
circumstance and uh when the court of

5384
04:07:23,159 --> 04:07:26,560
appeals says that uh justice Myers

5385
04:07:26,560 --> 04:07:29,880
continues on to paragraph 31 and says

5386
04:07:29,880 --> 04:07:31,640
the case involved an investigation and

5387
04:07:31,640 --> 04:07:33,439
held like many others that a claim in

5388
04:07:33,439 --> 04:07:35,479
negligence is available when the CRA

5389
04:07:35,479 --> 04:07:36,560
conducts an

5390
04:07:36,560 --> 04:07:39,080
investigation the reference to laru then

5391
04:07:39,080 --> 04:07:41,600
was obiter however McCrate certainly

5392
04:07:41,600 --> 04:07:44,080
suggests that if an audit case comes

5393
04:07:44,080 --> 04:07:47,479
along Laro May well be followed in

5394
04:07:47,479 --> 04:07:50,720
Ontario so the court of appeal is saying

5395
04:07:50,720 --> 04:07:52,600
this wasn't an audit case it was an

5396
04:07:52,600 --> 04:07:55,720
investigation or an enforcement case and

5397
04:07:55,720 --> 04:07:58,600
it's clear in that case uh the law that

5398
04:07:58,600 --> 04:08:02,159
applies but Justice Meyers notes that

5399
04:08:02,159 --> 04:08:04,840
the court of appeal is saying in an

5400
04:08:04,840 --> 04:08:08,760
audit uh there may be a duty of care ow

5401
04:08:08,760 --> 04:08:10,640
well why is that significant that's

5402
04:08:10,640 --> 04:08:13,720
significant because he then goes on to

5403
04:08:13,720 --> 04:08:15,640
decide the case and this is the portion

5404
04:08:15,640 --> 04:08:18,720
that my friend uh took you to he decides

5405
04:08:18,720 --> 04:08:22,520
it not on the basis of uh the court of

5406
04:08:22,520 --> 04:08:25,119
appeal he he says and this is it's an

5407
04:08:25,119 --> 04:08:28,880
interesting um discussion of um the role

5408
04:08:28,880 --> 04:08:30,840
of star decisis if you go with me to

5409
04:08:30,840 --> 04:08:34,279
paragraph 42 and following Justice

5410
04:08:34,279 --> 04:08:37,920
gleon yes um he says None of the

5411
04:08:37,920 --> 04:08:39,720
foregoing matters if I'm Bound by the

5412
04:08:39,720 --> 04:08:41,880
court of appeals decision in McCrate

5413
04:08:41,880 --> 04:08:43,960
which is of course is saying there is a

5414
04:08:43,960 --> 04:08:45,640
duty of care owed in an

5415
04:08:45,640 --> 04:08:48,760
audit uh there's a competing principle

5416
04:08:48,760 --> 04:08:50,760
and that's a comp principle of star

5417
04:08:50,760 --> 04:08:53,640
decisis he then goes on and I won't read

5418
04:08:53,640 --> 04:08:56,760
it all to you paragraph 45 he notes the

5419
04:08:56,760 --> 04:08:59,640
interesting doctrinal Pro

5420
04:08:59,640 --> 04:09:04,279
problem and paragraphs 49 and 50 are the

5421
04:09:04,279 --> 04:09:06,880
meat of this the reason this case that

5422
04:09:06,880 --> 04:09:08,840
my friends rely on stands for what it

5423
04:09:08,840 --> 04:09:12,080
stands on is that he says it stands for

5424
04:09:12,080 --> 04:09:13,520
what they say it stands for is that he

5425
04:09:13,520 --> 04:09:16,840
says he's Bound by two co-equal Superior

5426
04:09:16,840 --> 04:09:18,000
Court

5427
04:09:18,000 --> 04:09:21,239
decisions uh he notes at 49 it may well

5428
04:09:21,239 --> 04:09:22,760
be that the court of appeal will follow

5429
04:09:22,760 --> 04:09:25,040
McCrate and laru on appeal and overturn

5430
04:09:25,040 --> 04:09:27,239
this decision if so that would be an

5431
04:09:27,239 --> 04:09:29,000
example of the common law developing as

5432
04:09:29,000 --> 04:09:32,000
it should were I free to choose which

5433
04:09:32,000 --> 04:09:33,640
decision I want to follow judicial

5434
04:09:33,640 --> 04:09:35,279
States craft would push me to follow

5435
04:09:35,279 --> 04:09:37,840
McCrate but I am not free I have to

5436
04:09:37,840 --> 04:09:40,680
follow that my my two brothers who in

5437
04:09:40,680 --> 04:09:42,960
the in the case of an audit have found

5438
04:09:42,960 --> 04:09:46,479
that an audit by CRA there's no duty of

5439
04:09:46,479 --> 04:09:49,520
care but in our respectful

5440
04:09:49,520 --> 04:09:52,840
submission it is not at all Beyond doubt

5441
04:09:52,840 --> 04:09:55,159
that the Ontario courts are saying that

5442
04:09:55,159 --> 04:09:57,399
there's no duty of care even owed by the

5443
04:09:57,399 --> 04:10:00,600
CRA now we take a different view about

5444
04:10:00,600 --> 04:10:03,239
cbsa um there's some language in one of

5445
04:10:03,239 --> 04:10:05,880
the cases the taxman is not your friend

5446
04:10:05,880 --> 04:10:08,960
well cbsa is not like a not a tax man

5447
04:10:08,960 --> 04:10:12,439
cbsa in my friend's own submission are

5448
04:10:12,439 --> 04:10:15,199
responsible for or you know the the free

5449
04:10:15,199 --> 04:10:17,840
movement of of people and goods across

5450
04:10:17,840 --> 04:10:21,279
across uh uh borders they are not like a

5451
04:10:21,279 --> 04:10:22,319
taxing

5452
04:10:22,319 --> 04:10:25,640
Authority uh that is adverse in

5453
04:10:25,640 --> 04:10:29,399
interest so with all due respect to the

5454
04:10:29,399 --> 04:10:30,960
Juris Prudence that my friend cites in

5455
04:10:30,960 --> 04:10:34,520
jco it does not say what he says it says

5456
04:10:34,520 --> 04:10:35,880
and it does not stand for the

5457
04:10:35,880 --> 04:10:37,640
proposition that there cannot be a duty

5458
04:10:37,640 --> 04:10:38,880
of

5459
04:10:38,880 --> 04:10:42,560
care the salesman case which my friend

5460
04:10:42,560 --> 04:10:45,359
also refer too briefly that's at tab 46

5461
04:10:45,359 --> 04:10:48,399
we don't need to go there that is not a

5462
04:10:48,399 --> 04:10:50,159
a negligence case at all that's a

5463
04:10:50,159 --> 04:10:53,119
Judicial pardon me a judicial

5464
04:10:53,119 --> 04:10:56,399
review it's uh justice Leon's decision

5465
04:10:56,399 --> 04:10:58,399
it was a self-represented

5466
04:10:58,399 --> 04:11:01,279
plaintiff he was a divorce he missed

5467
04:11:01,279 --> 04:11:04,000
some filings he wanted an extension of

5468
04:11:04,000 --> 04:11:06,159
time and he complained that CRA wasn't

5469
04:11:06,159 --> 04:11:09,199
acting more like a bank there were no

5470
04:11:09,199 --> 04:11:11,399
allegations of negligence the court did

5471
04:11:11,399 --> 04:11:13,479
not consider whether it was duty of care

5472
04:11:13,479 --> 04:11:16,119
owing and the court made some remarks

5473
04:11:16,119 --> 04:11:20,399
about not CRA not owing uh a duty to

5474
04:11:20,399 --> 04:11:22,680
taxpayers but that doesn't in the case

5475
04:11:22,680 --> 04:11:25,880
of cbsa and and cbsa enforcement of the

5476
04:11:25,880 --> 04:11:28,319
Customs act speak at all to whether a

5477
04:11:28,319 --> 04:11:31,479
duty of care exists in that

5478
04:11:31,479 --> 04:11:34,880
context I can deal with the other cases

5479
04:11:34,880 --> 04:11:39,800
uh that my friend uh my friend cites

5480
04:11:39,800 --> 04:11:42,520
very briefly the swara case for the

5481
04:11:42,520 --> 04:11:47,279
indeterminate liability point that case

5482
04:11:47,279 --> 04:11:50,319
is not a case about uh indeterminate

5483
04:11:50,319 --> 04:11:53,199
liability in that case the private law

5484
04:11:53,199 --> 04:11:55,359
Duty that was alleged comes into direct

5485
04:11:55,359 --> 04:11:57,319
conflict with the purpose of the

5486
04:11:57,319 --> 04:12:01,000
regulatory scheme and and the judge so

5487
04:12:01,000 --> 04:12:03,319
finds so that that doesn't stand for

5488
04:12:03,319 --> 04:12:06,159
what my friend say it

5489
04:12:07,439 --> 04:12:09,680
says I think the bigger Point here

5490
04:12:09,680 --> 04:12:10,920
though to

5491
04:12:10,920 --> 04:12:14,159
emphasize is that the case before you as

5492
04:12:14,159 --> 04:12:16,600
my friends have admitted is

5493
04:12:16,600 --> 04:12:19,040
novel and it should not be this

5494
04:12:19,040 --> 04:12:20,680
important issue should not be decided on

5495
04:12:20,680 --> 04:12:22,840
a motion to strike the elements are

5496
04:12:22,840 --> 04:12:24,760
properly pleaded we've taken you through

5497
04:12:24,760 --> 04:12:29,439
paragraph 61 62 63 64 and a motion to

5498
04:12:29,439 --> 04:12:32,600
strike blows it out of the water these

5499
04:12:32,600 --> 04:12:36,159
also all these cases made it to trial uh

5500
04:12:36,159 --> 04:12:39,560
let me just uh let me just be sure of

5501
04:12:39,560 --> 04:12:43,359
that uh H humbi the humbi case which my

5502
04:12:43,359 --> 04:12:46,040
friends that was after a

5503
04:12:46,040 --> 04:12:48,119
trial

5504
04:12:48,119 --> 04:12:52,520
uh trying to see if suar made it to

5505
04:12:52,520 --> 04:12:55,080
trial anyway the bigger case is a motion

5506
04:12:55,080 --> 04:12:57,239
to strike isn't the place to do this to

5507
04:12:57,239 --> 04:13:00,600
make um pronouncements of principle

5508
04:13:00,600 --> 04:13:02,520
which in our submission would go against

5509
04:13:02,520 --> 04:13:04,040
what the Supreme Court of Canada has

5510
04:13:04,040 --> 04:13:07,159
said in Imperial tobacco it's properly

5511
04:13:07,159 --> 04:13:09,560
pleaded the damages are proper I'm going

5512
04:13:09,560 --> 04:13:11,399
to come to the damages in a second about

5513
04:13:11,399 --> 04:13:13,439
the the downstream damages of if I can

5514
04:13:13,439 --> 04:13:16,439
use my friend's uh wording and it it

5515
04:13:16,439 --> 04:13:19,279
needs to get to a trial of course my

5516
04:13:19,279 --> 04:13:23,479
friends don't want a trial with all the

5517
04:13:23,479 --> 04:13:26,080
all the documentary and oral Discovery

5518
04:13:26,080 --> 04:13:30,080
they would like the three summary

5519
04:13:30,840 --> 04:13:34,319
proceedings um in resp in response to a

5520
04:13:34,319 --> 04:13:37,319
couple other arguments that Mr Maher he

5521
04:13:37,319 --> 04:13:40,159
says uh this the Customs act does not

5522
04:13:40,159 --> 04:13:42,119
require the cbsa to verify all

5523
04:13:42,119 --> 04:13:44,720
importations of importers well with with

5524
04:13:44,720 --> 04:13:46,840
the utmost respect Ronco isn't saying it

5525
04:13:46,840 --> 04:13:49,239
does Ronco isn't saying that that's a

5526
04:13:49,239 --> 04:13:52,080
that's a straw man and we we never said

5527
04:13:52,080 --> 04:13:53,840
that and nobody would ever say that

5528
04:13:53,840 --> 04:13:57,119
self-reporting is of course a uh a

5529
04:13:57,119 --> 04:13:59,239
feature of this act but that doesn't

5530
04:13:59,239 --> 04:14:00,680
make this

5531
04:14:00,680 --> 04:14:02,960
conduct right it doesn't make it first

5532
04:14:02,960 --> 04:14:05,520
of all immune from immune from scrutiny

5533
04:14:05,520 --> 04:14:06,680
second of all on our submission it

5534
04:14:06,680 --> 04:14:09,319
doesn't make it right and third of all

5535
04:14:09,319 --> 04:14:11,319
it doesn't negate any duty of care in

5536
04:14:11,319 --> 04:14:15,040
the enforcement of the Customs Act

5537
04:14:15,640 --> 04:14:17,439
uh with respect to the advanced ruling I

5538
04:14:17,439 --> 04:14:19,000
think I answered your question my friend

5539
04:14:19,000 --> 04:14:22,000
Mr Maher may have been uh may have been

5540
04:14:22,000 --> 04:14:23,640
making a contributory negligence

5541
04:14:23,640 --> 04:14:26,239
argument why didn't FedEx on behalf of

5542
04:14:26,239 --> 04:14:29,159
Ronco go and get an advanced ruling that

5543
04:14:29,159 --> 04:14:30,760
that's open to them at trial that's

5544
04:14:30,760 --> 04:14:32,640
absolutely open to them at trial but

5545
04:14:32,640 --> 04:14:34,960
it's not a reason to strike this

5546
04:14:34,960 --> 04:14:38,319
pleading and uh the third argument and

5547
04:14:38,319 --> 04:14:40,279
I'm coming now to the Doug band the

5548
04:14:40,279 --> 04:14:42,040
famous Doug band

5549
04:14:42,040 --> 04:14:44,560
representations Ronco does not plead

5550
04:14:44,560 --> 04:14:45,840
negligent

5551
04:14:45,840 --> 04:14:47,720
misrepresentation it doesn't plead

5552
04:14:47,720 --> 04:14:51,119
Reliance and causation that is that's

5553
04:14:51,119 --> 04:14:55,040
straw man number two the band fact the

5554
04:14:55,040 --> 04:14:56,880
fact of the band meeting and there's

5555
04:14:56,880 --> 04:14:59,359
affidavit evidence before before the

5556
04:14:59,359 --> 04:15:01,880
various uh lower tribunals is part of

5557
04:15:01,880 --> 04:15:04,040
the overall negligent course of conduct

5558
04:15:04,040 --> 04:15:07,800
of cbsa that is alleged it is a material

5559
04:15:07,800 --> 04:15:09,880
fact it's a material fact that needs to

5560
04:15:09,880 --> 04:15:12,119
be pleaded on the rules of pleading and

5561
04:15:12,119 --> 04:15:15,800
that will be the subject matter of uh

5562
04:15:15,800 --> 04:15:19,040
Discovery and evidence at

5563
04:15:20,960 --> 04:15:23,239
trial I think I've made the point on

5564
04:15:23,239 --> 04:15:25,520
indeterminate liability and indeed your

5565
04:15:25,520 --> 04:15:26,960
question about don't I need some

5566
04:15:26,960 --> 04:15:29,439
evidence on that point uh I think that

5567
04:15:29,439 --> 04:15:32,960
speaks volume so oh but but my friend

5568
04:15:32,960 --> 04:15:35,119
did admit yes the circumstances of this

5569
04:15:35,119 --> 04:15:38,040
case are unique I hope they're we

5570
04:15:38,040 --> 04:15:39,920
certainly hope they're unique we hope

5571
04:15:39,920 --> 04:15:42,000
that there are no such uh there are not

5572
04:15:42,000 --> 04:15:44,239
other cases like this

5573
04:15:44,239 --> 04:15:47,439
but in in order to find an overriding

5574
04:15:47,439 --> 04:15:50,199
policy uh consideration that would

5575
04:15:50,199 --> 04:15:53,439
negate uh that would negate this duty of

5576
04:15:53,439 --> 04:15:55,479
care you need evidence and in our

5577
04:15:55,479 --> 04:15:58,800
respectful view you don't have

5578
04:15:59,279 --> 04:16:01,920
it

5579
04:16:01,920 --> 04:16:07,000
okay let me just have just a second

5580
04:16:19,010 --> 04:16:22,200
[Music]

5581
04:16:25,720 --> 04:16:27,040
unless there's other questions on the

5582
04:16:27,040 --> 04:16:28,640
negligence pleading I thought I'd move

5583
04:16:28,640 --> 04:16:30,960
on if I could to the uh Public Law

5584
04:16:30,960 --> 04:16:32,720
pleading Justice

5585
04:16:32,720 --> 04:16:36,080
Gleason yes go ahead public law is fine

5586
04:16:36,080 --> 04:16:40,199
and uh so in that

5587
04:16:41,840 --> 04:16:44,680
regard I'm going to obviously be talking

5588
04:16:44,680 --> 04:16:46,600
about the parody honey case which is a

5589
04:16:46,600 --> 04:16:51,319
tab 11 Justice Stratus's well-known uh

5590
04:16:51,319 --> 04:16:56,080
decision joined by uh justice

5591
04:16:56,080 --> 04:16:59,239
Nadal so the claim uh in this regard

5592
04:16:59,239 --> 04:17:01,399
relies on many of the same underlying

5593
04:17:01,399 --> 04:17:04,000
fact patterns it's a

5594
04:17:04,000 --> 04:17:06,359
distinct uh claim from the P from the

5595
04:17:06,359 --> 04:17:09,080
negligence claim it sits alongside

5596
04:17:09,080 --> 04:17:10,720
negligence and it's pleaded at

5597
04:17:10,720 --> 04:17:14,000
paragraphs 46 to 60

5598
04:17:14,000 --> 04:17:16,640
of our statement of

5599
04:17:16,640 --> 04:17:19,199
claim the gist of it is that there's

5600
04:17:19,199 --> 04:17:21,159
significant maladministration which is

5601
04:17:21,159 --> 04:17:24,199
both offensive to the public law values

5602
04:17:24,199 --> 04:17:26,520
and the terms of the statute but also

5603
04:17:26,520 --> 04:17:29,279
which causes real harm which should be

5604
04:17:29,279 --> 04:17:32,199
compensable in

5605
04:17:33,319 --> 04:17:36,760
Damages paragraphs 49 to 52 if you have

5606
04:17:36,760 --> 04:17:38,000
them ready to

5607
04:17:38,000 --> 04:17:41,319
hand are the key Public

5608
04:17:41,319 --> 04:17:44,840
Law uh

5609
04:17:45,000 --> 04:17:48,199
allegations by impo 49 I'll just read by

5610
04:17:48,199 --> 04:17:50,399
imposing retroactive duties on Ronco

5611
04:17:50,399 --> 04:17:52,560
cbsa treated Ronco differently than

5612
04:17:52,560 --> 04:17:55,000
similarly situated competitors who are

5613
04:17:55,000 --> 04:17:56,680
importing identical or substantially

5614
04:17:56,680 --> 04:17:58,399
similar Goods under the same tariff as

5615
04:17:58,399 --> 04:18:00,840
Ronco including sumomo and other

5616
04:18:00,840 --> 04:18:03,479
companies in doing so it unfairly

5617
04:18:03,479 --> 04:18:05,279
favored certain importers now my friend

5618
04:18:05,279 --> 04:18:07,600
says well that's like one speeder saying

5619
04:18:07,600 --> 04:18:09,640
there were other people speeding that

5620
04:18:09,640 --> 04:18:12,479
would be the case except if you that

5621
04:18:12,479 --> 04:18:14,319
would be perhaps analogous except if

5622
04:18:14,319 --> 04:18:18,359
you'd given uh the guy in the Camaro uh

5623
04:18:18,359 --> 04:18:20,520
an a letter saying it's okay for you to

5624
04:18:20,520 --> 04:18:23,119
drive at 160 kilometers an hour but

5625
04:18:23,119 --> 04:18:25,520
we're gonna we're going to audit Ronco

5626
04:18:25,520 --> 04:18:27,439
speed at

5627
04:18:27,439 --> 04:18:31,399
130 um the pleading at paragraph 50 cbsa

5628
04:18:31,399 --> 04:18:33,560
did not impose retroactive duties on any

5629
04:18:33,560 --> 04:18:35,279
other importer for importing those goods

5630
04:18:35,279 --> 04:18:38,399
under tariff 21 it did not conduct trade

5631
04:18:38,399 --> 04:18:40,080
compliance verification of any other

5632
04:18:40,080 --> 04:18:43,479
importer for conducts similar to ronos

5633
04:18:43,479 --> 04:18:45,880
paragraph 51 and 52 I won't read them

5634
04:18:45,880 --> 04:18:49,199
you're you're very familiar with them so

5635
04:18:49,199 --> 04:18:51,520
this has been styled we call it a parody

5636
04:18:51,520 --> 04:18:53,600
honey claim the facts of that case are

5637
04:18:53,600 --> 04:18:55,439
well known my friend Mr nosb and

5638
04:18:55,439 --> 04:18:58,159
referred to them that was a very similar

5639
04:18:58,159 --> 04:19:00,520
case a motion to strike

5640
04:19:00,520 --> 04:19:04,199
again uh the the minister had adopted a

5641
04:19:04,199 --> 04:19:06,040
blanket prohibition on the importation

5642
04:19:06,040 --> 04:19:08,920
of B packages I'm sure we are all

5643
04:19:08,920 --> 04:19:12,199
familiar with it uh the if you turn with

5644
04:19:12,199 --> 04:19:15,000
me to par paragraph 85 of the decision

5645
04:19:15,000 --> 04:19:18,720
which is the page 29 of our report that

5646
04:19:18,720 --> 04:19:21,119
we've put in there at tab

5647
04:19:21,119 --> 04:19:25,239
11 let me know when you get there

5648
04:19:28,880 --> 04:19:30,880
sir yes I'm

5649
04:19:30,880 --> 04:19:34,239
there so

5650
04:19:34,239 --> 04:19:37,920
um uh there's four bullets uh the

5651
04:19:37,920 --> 04:19:39,720
guideline is tan himount to a regulation

5652
04:19:39,720 --> 04:19:41,040
that should have passed his regulation

5653
04:19:41,040 --> 04:19:43,399
that doesn't apply here so these are the

5654
04:19:43,399 --> 04:19:45,159
facts which you'll see later Justice

5655
04:19:45,159 --> 04:19:47,439
Stratus keeps referring back to as if

5656
04:19:47,439 --> 04:19:50,680
proven could ground a a finding it's the

5657
04:19:50,680 --> 04:19:52,920
next three guideline imposes an absolute

5658
04:19:52,920 --> 04:19:54,560
prohibition against the importation and

5659
04:19:54,560 --> 04:19:57,239
conflicts with the law on the books well

5660
04:19:57,239 --> 04:19:59,040
that's very analogous to the case here

5661
04:19:59,040 --> 04:20:00,960
with respect to the law and the policy

5662
04:20:00,960 --> 04:20:03,279
with respect to reason to believe the

5663
04:20:03,279 --> 04:20:04,760
guideline is unreasonable within the

5664
04:20:04,760 --> 04:20:07,119
meaning of dunsmir it's not supported by

5665
04:20:07,119 --> 04:20:10,800
scientific evidence Etc my friend

5666
04:20:10,800 --> 04:20:13,239
reproaches Ronco for pleading un

5667
04:20:13,239 --> 04:20:15,080
reasonability and says well that that

5668
04:20:15,080 --> 04:20:17,119
unmasks the fact this is just a public

5669
04:20:17,119 --> 04:20:21,080
law claim well it was it was a public to

5670
04:20:21,080 --> 04:20:23,399
that extent uh parody honey deals with

5671
04:20:23,399 --> 04:20:25,439
that and I suppose technically is

5672
04:20:25,439 --> 04:20:28,239
binding on on this court coming as it

5673
04:20:28,239 --> 04:20:29,680
does from a federal court of appeal

5674
04:20:29,680 --> 04:20:32,239
although it is it is oberer the final

5675
04:20:32,239 --> 04:20:34,000
bullet is the key one a faction of

5676
04:20:34,000 --> 04:20:35,720
commercial beekeepers acting for their

5677
04:20:35,720 --> 04:20:37,600
own financial advantage captured the

5678
04:20:37,600 --> 04:20:39,760
bureaucracy and induced it to make the

5679
04:20:39,760 --> 04:20:41,960
guideline thus the guideline was enacted

5680
04:20:41,960 --> 04:20:44,279
for an improper ER purpose then he gives

5681
04:20:44,279 --> 04:20:47,119
some cases in

5682
04:20:47,680 --> 04:20:50,960
support the gist of these allegations in

5683
04:20:50,960 --> 04:20:52,920
parody honey were the actions were

5684
04:20:52,920 --> 04:20:55,560
inconsistent with the act and which were

5685
04:20:55,560 --> 04:20:58,279
essentially favoring one faction over

5686
04:20:58,279 --> 04:21:00,680
the other and the majority in parity

5687
04:21:00,680 --> 04:21:02,359
honey as we know held the pleading

5688
04:21:02,359 --> 04:21:04,359
should be allowed to stand both in

5689
04:21:04,359 --> 04:21:06,199
negligence and on the basis of a broader

5690
04:21:06,199 --> 04:21:09,359
right of action to seek R redress for

5691
04:21:09,359 --> 04:21:10,680
public

5692
04:21:10,680 --> 04:21:12,600
maladministration now this is not I

5693
04:21:12,600 --> 04:21:15,199
talked about novelty this is not a novel

5694
04:21:15,199 --> 04:21:17,279
idea and if you turn with me to

5695
04:21:17,279 --> 04:21:21,640
paragraph 131 of the decision Justice

5696
04:21:21,640 --> 04:21:25,560
gleon just be before we go there

5697
04:21:25,560 --> 04:21:28,560
um this parody had especially this last

5698
04:21:28,560 --> 04:21:31,119
bullet that that you referenced does not

5699
04:21:31,119 --> 04:21:33,399
that not suggest some element of bad

5700
04:21:33,399 --> 04:21:35,279
faith or improper

5701
04:21:35,279 --> 04:21:40,159
conduct and and if so is

5702
04:21:40,159 --> 04:21:42,880
that necessary

5703
04:21:42,880 --> 04:21:45,920
and is it pled in in this matter not

5704
04:21:45,920 --> 04:21:48,080
necessary we haven't pleaded bad faith

5705
04:21:48,080 --> 04:21:50,479
or fraud uh it's we haven't had

5706
04:21:50,479 --> 04:21:53,040
Discovery Justice gleon we haven't had

5707
04:21:53,040 --> 04:21:55,640
Discovery at all but uh I I point out no

5708
04:21:55,640 --> 04:21:57,760
it's not necessary for that it's not

5709
04:21:57,760 --> 04:21:59,399
necessary for a public law claim to

5710
04:21:59,399 --> 04:22:01,520
survive a motion to strike to be

5711
04:22:01,520 --> 04:22:04,640
ultimately successful after a trial on

5712
04:22:04,640 --> 04:22:07,239
the issues it may be and that's really

5713
04:22:07,239 --> 04:22:09,520
for this court and the trial judge to

5714
04:22:09,520 --> 04:22:11,880
determine but to survive a motion to

5715
04:22:11,880 --> 04:22:15,319
strike you don't have to uh to

5716
04:22:15,319 --> 04:22:19,319
allege uh bad faith we have to be

5717
04:22:19,319 --> 04:22:22,680
brutally Frank we have no idea uh why

5718
04:22:22,680 --> 04:22:25,239
cbsa has acted as it has over the past

5719
04:22:25,239 --> 04:22:28,840
14 or 15 years it's it's it's like being

5720
04:22:28,840 --> 04:22:31,680
caught in a circle I called it Snakes

5721
04:22:31,680 --> 04:22:34,279
and Ladders you can also make analogies

5722
04:22:34,279 --> 04:22:37,880
to Dante's level of hell because Ronco

5723
04:22:37,880 --> 04:22:41,239
knows Ronco knows not what motivates

5724
04:22:41,239 --> 04:22:43,439
these these various actors and these

5725
04:22:43,439 --> 04:22:45,000
various

5726
04:22:45,000 --> 04:22:47,239
decisions but it's not necessary for the

5727
04:22:47,239 --> 04:22:48,960
pleading to stand if that's if that's

5728
04:22:48,960 --> 04:22:51,279
the question sir that that is the

5729
04:22:51,279 --> 04:22:55,800
question thank you so so given that um

5730
04:22:55,800 --> 04:22:58,359
how how pertinent or helpful is is this

5731
04:22:58,359 --> 04:23:03,159
final Bullet at uh at paragraph 85 of uh

5732
04:23:03,159 --> 04:23:05,520
parody honey it is helpful bear with me

5733
04:23:05,520 --> 04:23:06,520
because I'm going to take you down to

5734
04:23:06,520 --> 04:23:09,439
paragraph 131 all right I'm with you

5735
04:23:09,439 --> 04:23:12,520
you're with me okay so paragraph 131 jce

5736
04:23:12,520 --> 04:23:15,000
Stratus is talking about and and you're

5737
04:23:15,000 --> 04:23:16,760
familiar with the case so it's this is

5738
04:23:16,760 --> 04:23:19,040
in the context of a broader discussion

5739
04:23:19,040 --> 04:23:21,600
of integrating if you will remedies

5740
04:23:21,600 --> 04:23:24,159
against public uh public officials but

5741
04:23:24,159 --> 04:23:26,520
he says this idea is not so novel in the

5742
04:23:26,520 --> 04:23:28,640
past on multiple occasions Supreme Court

5743
04:23:28,640 --> 04:23:30,040
has suggested public authorities could

5744
04:23:30,040 --> 04:23:32,199
be liable when they act quote without

5745
04:23:32,199 --> 04:23:34,359
legal justification

5746
04:23:34,359 --> 04:23:36,720
unquote a concept that seems to Echo

5747
04:23:36,720 --> 04:23:39,040
Public Law principle not private law TS

5748
04:23:39,040 --> 04:23:43,199
and that's he gives the con case

5749
04:23:43,199 --> 04:23:46,119
and then uh further on he so without

5750
04:23:46,119 --> 04:23:49,000
legal justification is is one bullet but

5751
04:23:49,000 --> 04:23:50,680
then he he makes reference to the

5752
04:23:50,680 --> 04:23:52,960
mcgilvery case of which I'm not familiar

5753
04:23:52,960 --> 04:23:54,640
but to Ron Carelli and

5754
04:23:54,640 --> 04:23:57,760
dupc Ron Carelli and dupc of course we

5755
04:23:57,760 --> 04:24:00,880
all uh we all read it in law school we

5756
04:24:00,880 --> 04:24:02,520
know the facts very well it's a

5757
04:24:02,520 --> 04:24:05,680
Jehovah's Witness bar owner in Montreal

5758
04:24:05,680 --> 04:24:09,000
who uh Premier dup decides to yank his

5759
04:24:09,000 --> 04:24:13,119
license um let's let's

5760
04:24:13,119 --> 04:24:16,199
consider Justice Stratus's invocation of

5761
04:24:16,199 --> 04:24:18,880
that case in this in this motion to

5762
04:24:18,880 --> 04:24:21,439
strike and if I if I could let me give

5763
04:24:21,439 --> 04:24:23,800
you a hypothetical can you imagine there

5764
04:24:23,800 --> 04:24:26,800
are8 to 10 bars on Crescent Street in

5765
04:24:26,800 --> 04:24:29,399
Montreal and the two biggest bars one's

5766
04:24:29,399 --> 04:24:32,640
called ronos and one's called sumat

5767
04:24:32,640 --> 04:24:35,479
Tomos all operate with a license from

5768
04:24:35,479 --> 04:24:36,319
the

5769
04:24:36,319 --> 04:24:39,560
government All These Bars sell beer

5770
04:24:39,560 --> 04:24:41,560
imported from China because that's the

5771
04:24:41,560 --> 04:24:44,080
hottest product at the time and you need

5772
04:24:44,080 --> 04:24:46,880
an import license to sell that

5773
04:24:46,880 --> 04:24:51,840
beer ronos is run by Mr roncarelli

5774
04:24:51,840 --> 04:24:55,119
the government suddenly Yanks Mr ronc

5775
04:24:55,119 --> 04:24:59,119
carelli's license and worse it goes back

5776
04:24:59,119 --> 04:25:01,960
and imposes a penalty for four years of

5777
04:25:01,960 --> 04:25:04,600
past importation of Chinese

5778
04:25:04,600 --> 04:25:07,359
beer but an additional fact gets to be

5779
04:25:07,359 --> 04:25:10,399
added to uh

5780
04:25:10,399 --> 04:25:14,279
to um this fact pattern is that 13 years

5781
04:25:14,279 --> 04:25:18,479
earlier Mr sumomo was promised that they

5782
04:25:18,479 --> 04:25:20,600
could import this Chinese

5783
04:25:20,600 --> 04:25:22,600
beer without

5784
04:25:22,600 --> 04:25:25,359
duty all the other bars keep on

5785
04:25:25,359 --> 04:25:31,119
operating nobody is is um refused the

5786
04:25:31,119 --> 04:25:33,159
importation of Chinese beer except Mr

5787
04:25:33,159 --> 04:25:34,239
Ron

5788
04:25:34,239 --> 04:25:35,800
scarelli

5789
04:25:35,800 --> 04:25:39,680
so that's a fact pattern it's analogous

5790
04:25:39,680 --> 04:25:42,479
to the fact pattern before you sir and I

5791
04:25:42,479 --> 04:25:43,720
say that what the Supreme Court of

5792
04:25:43,720 --> 04:25:46,520
Canada did in 1959 with Justice Rand and

5793
04:25:46,520 --> 04:25:49,399
others said that Mr Ron Carelli was

5794
04:25:49,399 --> 04:25:53,920
entitled to damages based on Mr dup's

5795
04:25:53,920 --> 04:25:57,000
treatment we could add the fact that Mr

5796
04:25:57,000 --> 04:25:59,399
Ron scarelli in my hypothetical was a

5797
04:25:59,399 --> 04:26:01,159
Jehovah's Witness but in our submission

5798
04:26:01,159 --> 04:26:04,279
he doesn't need to be that that that was

5799
04:26:04,279 --> 04:26:07,439
a key fact in Ron Carelli it it doesn't

5800
04:26:07,439 --> 04:26:08,960
need that for this because you've got

5801
04:26:08,960 --> 04:26:11,800
the promise to Mr sumomo who operates

5802
04:26:11,800 --> 04:26:16,119
sum bar on Crescent Street so here today

5803
04:26:16,119 --> 04:26:18,880
in in 2021 doesn't Mr Ron scarelli get a

5804
04:26:18,880 --> 04:26:20,520
chance to pursue his case before the

5805
04:26:20,520 --> 04:26:22,080
courts we're not saying he's going to

5806
04:26:22,080 --> 04:26:24,359
win his case but we're saying you can't

5807
04:26:24,359 --> 04:26:26,399
knock it out of the box that's what the

5808
04:26:26,399 --> 04:26:27,520
rule of

5809
04:26:27,520 --> 04:26:30,040
law is and that's what parody honey is

5810
04:26:30,040 --> 04:26:32,520
giving voice to in our submission this

5811
04:26:32,520 --> 04:26:34,399
is the this parody honey is saying there

5812
04:26:34,399 --> 04:26:36,640
needs to be a when there's a wrong there

5813
04:26:36,640 --> 04:26:39,399
needs to be a remedy this is the rule of

5814
04:26:39,399 --> 04:26:41,279
law in a society where the state has

5815
04:26:41,279 --> 04:26:42,960
more and more influence

5816
04:26:42,960 --> 04:26:45,680
in our lives over importers private

5817
04:26:45,680 --> 04:26:50,239
citizens clients customers

5818
04:26:50,239 --> 04:26:53,760
Etc this is what our action Ron's action

5819
04:26:53,760 --> 04:26:57,159
seeks is Meaningful redress like Mr Ron

5820
04:26:57,159 --> 04:26:58,439
Carelli got in

5821
04:26:58,439 --> 04:27:00,720
1959 and that's what the facts as

5822
04:27:00,720 --> 04:27:02,040
pleaded here

5823
04:27:02,040 --> 04:27:05,319
today uh require to be determined at the

5824
04:27:05,319 --> 04:27:09,119
end of a trial with proper

5825
04:27:09,119 --> 04:27:10,760
Discovery

5826
04:27:10,760 --> 04:27:14,319
now my friend said this new case of

5827
04:27:14,319 --> 04:27:18,319
Nelson and Mary really changes things

5828
04:27:18,319 --> 04:27:20,600
because uh because the Supreme Court of

5829
04:27:20,600 --> 04:27:23,800
Canada has said parody honey no no no

5830
04:27:23,800 --> 04:27:26,399
well if do you have if you're able to

5831
04:27:26,399 --> 04:27:28,439
turn that one up sir I'm going to

5832
04:27:28,439 --> 04:27:29,960
suggest that that is not the proper

5833
04:27:29,960 --> 04:27:33,840
reading at all of that

5834
04:27:40,000 --> 04:27:44,560
case let me know if you when you have

5835
04:27:44,560 --> 04:27:49,439
it yes I have it I'll just be one

5836
04:27:55,600 --> 04:27:58,199
second so this is another it seems like

5837
04:27:58,199 --> 04:28:00,080
all the all the Public Authority

5838
04:28:00,080 --> 04:28:02,159
negligence cases deal with clearing snow

5839
04:28:02,159 --> 04:28:04,520
in BC anyway it's another it's another

5840
04:28:04,520 --> 04:28:08,720
one of those and um uh what what my

5841
04:28:08,720 --> 04:28:11,479
friend pointed you to besides being if I

5842
04:28:11,479 --> 04:28:13,720
may say a bit grat a bit of a gratuitous

5843
04:28:13,720 --> 04:28:15,640
slap that the Supreme Court didn't need

5844
04:28:15,640 --> 04:28:18,279
to didn't need to do is an argument that

5845
04:28:18,279 --> 04:28:20,040
was being made by

5846
04:28:20,040 --> 04:28:22,319
abbottford which with all due respect to

5847
04:28:22,319 --> 04:28:24,640
the city of abbottsford was a crazy

5848
04:28:24,640 --> 04:28:27,359
argument the the the argument that they

5849
04:28:27,359 --> 04:28:29,479
make if I could take it to paragraph

5850
04:28:29,479 --> 04:28:33,600
40 paragraph 40 of the decision yes I I

5851
04:28:33,600 --> 04:28:36,720
I'm they've they've been through uh

5852
04:28:36,720 --> 04:28:38,760
they've been through the sort of the

5853
04:28:38,760 --> 04:28:40,359
history of negligence actions against

5854
04:28:40,359 --> 04:28:43,080
public authorities and then they say

5855
04:28:43,080 --> 04:28:45,040
third line some even argue that private

5856
04:28:45,040 --> 04:28:46,800
law principles of negligence are wholly

5857
04:28:46,800 --> 04:28:48,479
incompatible with the role and nature of

5858
04:28:48,479 --> 04:28:50,880
public authorities echoing the obiter

5859
04:28:50,880 --> 04:28:53,680
and parody honey uh for example the city

5860
04:28:53,680 --> 04:28:55,880
of abbotford intervened to propose the

5861
04:28:55,880 --> 04:28:58,439
only public law princip that sorry that

5862
04:28:58,439 --> 04:29:00,359
only Public Law principle should govern

5863
04:29:00,359 --> 04:29:02,840
Public Authority liability instead of

5864
04:29:02,840 --> 04:29:05,040
examining how core policy immunity

5865
04:29:05,040 --> 04:29:06,520
operates within negligence law it

5866
04:29:06,520 --> 04:29:08,000
suggests that Court should focus on

5867
04:29:08,000 --> 04:29:09,920
indefensible in the administrative law

5868
04:29:09,920 --> 04:29:12,600
sense and exercise remedial discretion

5869
04:29:12,600 --> 04:29:14,439
were appropriate to Grant monetary

5870
04:29:14,439 --> 04:29:17,760
relief well with all due respect that

5871
04:29:17,760 --> 04:29:19,920
was not a very sensible argument by the

5872
04:29:19,920 --> 04:29:21,800
city of abbottford and the Supreme Court

5873
04:29:21,800 --> 04:29:23,159
told them

5874
04:29:23,159 --> 04:29:25,359
so

5875
04:29:25,359 --> 04:29:27,760
um they were arguing essentially that

5876
04:29:27,760 --> 04:29:29,800
parody honey should supplant all the

5877
04:29:29,800 --> 04:29:31,760
traditional tort analysis for public

5878
04:29:31,760 --> 04:29:33,960
authorities the Supreme Court of Canada

5879
04:29:33,960 --> 04:29:38,040
rightly says no and it Abbotsford is

5880
04:29:38,040 --> 04:29:40,119
going far too far it's saying abandon

5881
04:29:40,119 --> 04:29:42,080
the ANS and burrow of Merton Council

5882
04:29:42,080 --> 04:29:45,359
soul and Cooper tests and and the

5883
04:29:45,359 --> 04:29:47,119
Supreme Court is saying here such an

5884
04:29:47,119 --> 04:29:48,840
approach has no basis in this Court's

5885
04:29:48,840 --> 04:29:52,640
Juris Prudence it also runs counter to

5886
04:29:52,640 --> 04:29:54,920
proed counter the crown proceedings

5887
04:29:54,920 --> 04:29:58,080
legislation in Canada that's all this

5888
04:29:58,080 --> 04:30:00,520
case is saying this case should be read

5889
04:30:00,520 --> 04:30:03,000
in our respectful view as saying the

5890
04:30:03,000 --> 04:30:05,000
contrary governments and Public

5891
04:30:05,000 --> 04:30:07,479
Authority should be open to private law

5892
04:30:07,479 --> 04:30:10,040
causes of action on the developed

5893
04:30:10,040 --> 04:30:12,880
negligence test I.E on the Imperial

5894
04:30:12,880 --> 04:30:16,159
tobacco negligence test except in cases

5895
04:30:16,159 --> 04:30:18,439
of core policy

5896
04:30:18,439 --> 04:30:21,159
decisions core policy decisions they say

5897
04:30:21,159 --> 04:30:22,760
should be immunized and it gives you a

5898
04:30:22,760 --> 04:30:24,439
long discussion about what constitutes a

5899
04:30:24,439 --> 04:30:26,600
core policy decision I don't hear my

5900
04:30:26,600 --> 04:30:29,680
friends here saying that the decision to

5901
04:30:29,680 --> 04:30:32,479
um uh that the decision at bar was a

5902
04:30:32,479 --> 04:30:35,279
core policy

5903
04:30:37,040 --> 04:30:40,359
decision however so it it does seem a

5904
04:30:40,359 --> 04:30:43,640
bit it does seem a bit curious that they

5905
04:30:43,640 --> 04:30:46,760
that they saw fit to to um slap

5906
04:30:46,760 --> 04:30:48,279
abbottsford if I can put it that way

5907
04:30:48,279 --> 04:30:50,760
with reference to Justice Stratus's

5908
04:30:50,760 --> 04:30:53,199
decision but I leave it at that I say a

5909
04:30:53,199 --> 04:30:54,520
proper reading of Supreme Court of

5910
04:30:54,520 --> 04:30:58,119
Canada is parody honey is alive and well

5911
04:30:58,119 --> 04:30:59,880
and that and that what they were saying

5912
04:30:59,880 --> 04:31:02,720
is abbottford was going far too far but

5913
04:31:02,720 --> 04:31:04,840
if parody honey were to be viewed as a

5914
04:31:04,840 --> 04:31:07,760
dead letter as my friend seem to suggest

5915
04:31:07,760 --> 04:31:09,680
then what this case is saying is there

5916
04:31:09,680 --> 04:31:12,279
must be room in a proper tort analog

5917
04:31:12,279 --> 04:31:16,920
Anis for uh this kind of public

5918
04:31:16,920 --> 04:31:20,439
malfeasance public maladministration

5919
04:31:20,439 --> 04:31:22,600
negligence the fact scenario like the

5920
04:31:22,600 --> 04:31:25,000
case at bar if parody honey Isn't the

5921
04:31:25,000 --> 04:31:27,119
label under which it comes to be

5922
04:31:27,119 --> 04:31:28,880
scrutinized because if we live in a

5923
04:31:28,880 --> 04:31:30,560
society where there is rule of law it

5924
04:31:30,560 --> 04:31:32,600
has to be scrutinized the allegations in

5925
04:31:32,600 --> 04:31:34,439
the statement of claim have to be able

5926
04:31:34,439 --> 04:31:36,920
to be scrutinized and meaningful redress

5927
04:31:36,920 --> 04:31:38,000
has to be

5928
04:31:38,000 --> 04:31:40,439
available then it should be under the

5929
04:31:40,439 --> 04:31:42,520
the negligence uh the developed

5930
04:31:42,520 --> 04:31:46,800
negligence standard that um that has the

5931
04:31:46,800 --> 04:31:48,760
Supreme Court of Canada has developed

5932
04:31:48,760 --> 04:31:51,319
over 30

5933
04:31:53,279 --> 04:31:57,080
years final case

5934
04:31:57,080 --> 04:31:59,560
so unless there's questions on the

5935
04:31:59,560 --> 04:32:03,199
public law parody honey uh pleadings I

5936
04:32:03,199 --> 04:32:04,720
I'll move on does that make sense

5937
04:32:04,720 --> 04:32:07,359
Justice Leon yes no that's uh that's

5938
04:32:07,359 --> 04:32:09,840
fine you can move on thank you I

5939
04:32:09,840 --> 04:32:12,479
referred you U to the of Snakes and

5940
04:32:12,479 --> 04:32:15,159
Ladder is directions that Ronco received

5941
04:32:15,159 --> 04:32:16,960
my friend Mr travisano is going to take

5942
04:32:16,960 --> 04:32:19,080
you through that in Greater difficulty

5943
04:32:19,080 --> 04:32:21,000
Sue Ogie from

5944
04:32:21,000 --> 04:32:26,399
cbsa um her her advice Miss Ali Muhammad

5945
04:32:26,399 --> 04:32:29,319
her advice the Department of Justice

5946
04:32:29,319 --> 04:32:31,439
neither of those two pieces of advice

5947
04:32:31,439 --> 04:32:34,479
were right do what do as we say go go to

5948
04:32:34,479 --> 04:32:35,720
the

5949
04:32:35,720 --> 04:32:38,880
CIT um I want to speak a bit about what

5950
04:32:38,880 --> 04:32:42,319
the tazone case teaches us about this

5951
04:32:42,319 --> 04:32:46,439
approach in tone you have at tab six

5952
04:32:46,439 --> 04:32:48,479
that again is a unanimous decision of

5953
04:32:48,479 --> 04:32:49,239
the

5954
04:32:49,239 --> 04:32:53,040
Court written by Justice

5955
04:32:58,880 --> 04:33:02,279
bny uh I'm going to be

5956
04:33:02,279 --> 04:33:04,920
starting well I'll just just refresh us

5957
04:33:04,920 --> 04:33:08,639
all on this was a 2010 case Justice B

5958
04:33:08,639 --> 04:33:11,160
writing for the court um he's he's

5959
04:33:11,160 --> 04:33:13,039
facing again a motion to strike the

5960
04:33:13,039 --> 04:33:14,520
Attorney General of Canada bringing

5961
04:33:14,520 --> 04:33:16,600
motion to strike facing a similar

5962
04:33:16,600 --> 04:33:18,199
argument as you face here the Attorney

5963
04:33:18,199 --> 04:33:20,119
General was saying you can't bring an

5964
04:33:20,119 --> 04:33:22,439
action in Damages because you need to go

5965
04:33:22,439 --> 04:33:24,879
to JR this is a thinly veiled attempt to

5966
04:33:24,879 --> 04:33:28,039
get a public law remedy uh in our

5967
04:33:28,039 --> 04:33:29,639
submission the fact that it was the

5968
04:33:29,639 --> 04:33:32,639
Ontario Court in that telone case versus

5969
04:33:32,639 --> 04:33:34,600
the federal court trial division here is

5970
04:33:34,600 --> 04:33:36,359
of no is of no

5971
04:33:36,359 --> 04:33:39,561
matter um and I've pointed out to you

5972
04:33:39,561 --> 04:33:41,240
already in our amended statement of

5973
04:33:41,240 --> 04:33:44,080
claim we've agreed to strike paragraph

5974
04:33:44,080 --> 04:33:46,561
1A um

5975
04:33:46,561 --> 04:33:51,080
uh so uh the it is really on all fours

5976
04:33:51,080 --> 04:33:52,639
with the tazone

5977
04:33:52,639 --> 04:33:55,359
facts this is this RS is now an action

5978
04:33:55,359 --> 04:33:57,959
in Damages or public Mal Administration

5979
04:33:57,959 --> 04:34:00,039
it's an action in damages caused by the

5980
04:34:00,039 --> 04:34:01,320
crown

5981
04:34:01,320 --> 04:34:03,959
conduct in applying the Customs act in

5982
04:34:03,959 --> 04:34:06,959
an inconsistent and unfair manner in

5983
04:34:06,959 --> 04:34:09,920
singling out Ronco for punitive

5984
04:34:09,920 --> 04:34:12,320
treatment and in preferring ing its

5985
04:34:12,320 --> 04:34:15,920
competitor in a competitive

5986
04:34:16,080 --> 04:34:19,080
landscape with respect damages that are

5987
04:34:19,080 --> 04:34:21,119
recoverable by Ronco are a matter for

5988
04:34:21,119 --> 04:34:23,119
the trial judge to quantify after

5989
04:34:23,119 --> 04:34:26,561
hearing all the evidence in this issue

5990
04:34:26,561 --> 04:34:28,920
tazone as you'll recall was trying to

5991
04:34:28,920 --> 04:34:31,400
fix the problems left by Grenier the

5992
04:34:31,400 --> 04:34:33,959
grer decision and Justice bny I'll

5993
04:34:33,959 --> 04:34:36,799
direct you to paragraphs 33 to 41 of

5994
04:34:36,799 --> 04:34:39,920
this case that's maybe where we can

5995
04:34:39,920 --> 04:34:42,359
start uh

5996
04:34:42,359 --> 04:34:45,400
the the argument of

5997
04:34:45,400 --> 04:34:48,760
the Attorney General in tone was

5998
04:34:48,760 --> 04:34:50,760
essentially the same argument as here

5999
04:34:50,760 --> 04:34:52,240
you have to stay in what are called

6000
04:34:52,240 --> 04:34:54,840
separate silos you you got to get this

6001
04:34:54,840 --> 04:34:56,320
kind of relief over here you got to get

6002
04:34:56,320 --> 04:34:58,680
this kind of relief over here uh you

6003
04:34:58,680 --> 04:35:00,480
have to challenge the penalty in one

6004
04:35:00,480 --> 04:35:03,000
proceeding where the where where you can

6005
04:35:03,000 --> 04:35:04,840
possibly if you're successful get $1,000

6006
04:35:04,840 --> 04:35:07,840
do back you have to challenge the Das

6007
04:35:07,840 --> 04:35:09,840
before the CIT which has no power to

6008
04:35:09,840 --> 04:35:12,920
award damages you have you can't your

6009
04:35:12,920 --> 04:35:15,600
damages for business loss where do we

6010
04:35:15,600 --> 04:35:18,240
get those it's not clear where You' get

6011
04:35:18,240 --> 04:35:20,520
those um but the Attorney General here

6012
04:35:20,520 --> 04:35:23,561
today is saying you can't say the cbsa

6013
04:35:23,561 --> 04:35:24,959
was negligent because that's a

6014
04:35:24,959 --> 04:35:27,160
collateral attack on these three other

6015
04:35:27,160 --> 04:35:29,561
type of administrative decisions and you

6016
04:35:29,561 --> 04:35:31,639
can't get Discovery you can't get

6017
04:35:31,639 --> 04:35:33,760
damages you got to stick to your

6018
04:35:33,760 --> 04:35:38,320
silos well Justice bny talks about this

6019
04:35:38,320 --> 04:35:42,600
and he notes at paragraph 37

6020
04:35:42,600 --> 04:35:43,920
that the federal court of appeal is

6021
04:35:43,920 --> 04:35:48,719
losing its enthusiasm for this kind of

6022
04:35:49,561 --> 04:35:53,561
view and in tazone so paragraph 37 you

6023
04:35:53,561 --> 04:35:56,000
say uh the type of argument that

6024
04:35:56,000 --> 04:35:57,920
basically you're facing here today even

6025
04:35:57,920 --> 04:35:59,879
the federal court of appeal back in 2008

6026
04:35:59,879 --> 04:36:02,080
n and 10 was losing its enthusiasm for

6027
04:36:02,080 --> 04:36:04,439
this separate silos

6028
04:36:04,439 --> 04:36:07,600
argument and Justice Binny is saying

6029
04:36:07,600 --> 04:36:09,840
this is an access to Justice question

6030
04:36:09,840 --> 04:36:12,400
this is really we don't want to

6031
04:36:12,400 --> 04:36:14,639
bifurcate or trifurcate the issues into

6032
04:36:14,639 --> 04:36:16,279
three separate

6033
04:36:16,279 --> 04:36:20,160
proceedings and

6034
04:36:20,760 --> 04:36:24,160
um I want to then take you if I

6035
04:36:24,160 --> 04:36:29,000
could paragraph 76 and

6036
04:36:32,160 --> 04:36:37,160
78 let me know when you get there

6037
04:36:44,119 --> 04:36:47,840
okay I'm there paragraph 76 says where a

6038
04:36:47,840 --> 04:36:49,160
plaintiff's pleading alleges the

6039
04:36:49,160 --> 04:36:51,840
elements of a private cause of action

6040
04:36:51,840 --> 04:36:53,359
the provincial Superior

6041
04:36:53,359 --> 04:36:55,639
Court I think the provincial Superior

6042
04:36:55,639 --> 04:36:57,080
Court should not in general decline

6043
04:36:57,080 --> 04:36:58,799
jurisdiction on the basis that the claim

6044
04:36:58,799 --> 04:37:00,359
looks like a case that could be pursued

6045
04:37:00,359 --> 04:37:02,760
on judicial review if the plaintiff has

6046
04:37:02,760 --> 04:37:05,199
a valid cause of action for damages he

6047
04:37:05,199 --> 04:37:08,840
or she is normally entitled to pursue it

6048
04:37:08,840 --> 04:37:12,879
and then you go uh paragraph 78

6049
04:37:12,879 --> 04:37:15,000
and I'll just he he talks about some UK

6050
04:37:15,000 --> 04:37:16,320
case law in

6051
04:37:16,320 --> 04:37:20,000
77 uh and then paragraph 78 generally

6052
04:37:20,000 --> 04:37:21,480
speaking the fundamental issue will

6053
04:37:21,480 --> 04:37:22,840
always be whether the claimant has

6054
04:37:22,840 --> 04:37:24,719
pleaded a reasonable private cause of

6055
04:37:24,719 --> 04:37:27,400
action for damages is the last four

6056
04:37:27,400 --> 04:37:29,879
lines if so he or she should generally

6057
04:37:29,879 --> 04:37:33,119
be allowed to get on with it

6058
04:37:33,119 --> 04:37:36,561
well let's look at what the pleading on

6059
04:37:36,561 --> 04:37:39,480
Damages are and my friends obviously

6060
04:37:39,480 --> 04:37:41,561
focused on the damages that happened to

6061
04:37:41,561 --> 04:37:45,520
have the same numbers as uh the duties

6062
04:37:45,520 --> 04:37:48,680
but let's look at paragraphs 14 to 17 of

6063
04:37:48,680 --> 04:37:52,320
the pleading if we could Justice

6064
04:37:52,320 --> 04:37:57,719
gleon 14 to is business damages lost

6065
04:37:57,719 --> 04:37:59,600
there's a million dollars pleaded it

6066
04:37:59,600 --> 04:38:02,600
could be amended tomorrow to10 million

6067
04:38:02,600 --> 04:38:04,439
and and there's nothing offensive about

6068
04:38:04,439 --> 04:38:07,000
such an amendment and that would easily

6069
04:38:07,000 --> 04:38:08,879
cover the pleadings which my friends say

6070
04:38:08,879 --> 04:38:12,439
are offensive so the number this is

6071
04:38:12,439 --> 04:38:13,760
really a question about measure of

6072
04:38:13,760 --> 04:38:15,320
Damages and that's up for the trial

6073
04:38:15,320 --> 04:38:18,240
judge to decide at the end of a trial

6074
04:38:18,240 --> 04:38:20,480
but let's look there General damages are

6075
04:38:20,480 --> 04:38:23,719
pleaded paragraphs 14 and 15 talk about

6076
04:38:23,719 --> 04:38:27,561
the industry paragraphs 16 and 17

6077
04:38:27,561 --> 04:38:31,639
expressly talk about Ron's plans to

6078
04:38:31,639 --> 04:38:33,879
expand its operation in western Canada

6079
04:38:33,879 --> 04:38:37,359
by opening a wheel shop and why western

6080
04:38:37,359 --> 04:38:40,320
Canada was a relevant market for it why

6081
04:38:40,320 --> 04:38:42,199
it would have been profitable how much

6082
04:38:42,199 --> 04:38:43,680
it would have

6083
04:38:43,680 --> 04:38:47,119
invested these plans says paragraph 16

6084
04:38:47,119 --> 04:38:49,799
which is presumed to be true were

6085
04:38:49,799 --> 04:38:52,480
upended due to the imposition of a 99.5%

6086
04:38:52,480 --> 04:38:54,600
duty on the

6087
04:38:54,600 --> 04:38:58,000
wheels paragraph 17 as a result Ronco

6088
04:38:58,000 --> 04:38:59,959
has been unable to expand its operation

6089
04:38:59,959 --> 04:39:01,959
as planned and Canadian customers many

6090
04:39:01,959 --> 04:39:03,240
of whom do not have their own wheel

6091
04:39:03,240 --> 04:39:05,680
shops continue to be serviced from the

6092
04:39:05,680 --> 04:39:08,400
American companies these are damages

6093
04:39:08,400 --> 04:39:11,439
these are lost profits this is lost

6094
04:39:11,439 --> 04:39:14,320
business opportunity and they're pleaded

6095
04:39:14,320 --> 04:39:16,359
they aren't my friends wanted

6096
04:39:16,359 --> 04:39:18,320
particulars of the million dollars and

6097
04:39:18,320 --> 04:39:20,520
we said case law says we give that to

6098
04:39:20,520 --> 04:39:22,799
you at a later stage and my friend

6099
04:39:22,799 --> 04:39:24,240
acknowledged that I think Mr Maher

6100
04:39:24,240 --> 04:39:27,920
actually acknowledged that so um we say

6101
04:39:27,920 --> 04:39:30,520
it is properly pleaded and to come back

6102
04:39:30,520 --> 04:39:31,639
to Justice

6103
04:39:31,639 --> 04:39:35,400
Benny's uh uh to come back to Justice

6104
04:39:35,400 --> 04:39:38,280
Ben's admonition if so he or she should

6105
04:39:38,280 --> 04:39:40,480
generally be allowed to get on with it

6106
04:39:40,480 --> 04:39:41,798
well let's get on with it this has been

6107
04:39:41,798 --> 04:39:43,600
more than a year a year and a half in

6108
04:39:43,600 --> 04:39:45,240
this motion to strike

6109
04:39:45,240 --> 04:39:49,360
limbo and my my other friend Mr nosb and

6110
04:39:49,360 --> 04:39:51,600
says it's a collateral attack he says

6111
04:39:51,600 --> 04:39:53,560
well look you've you've expressly

6112
04:39:53,560 --> 04:39:57,280
enumerated the dollar values of of the

6113
04:39:57,280 --> 04:40:00,440
um of the uh duties and so by

6114
04:40:00,440 --> 04:40:02,280
eliminating paragraph 1A you're just

6115
04:40:02,280 --> 04:40:04,280
sort of it's just window dressing it's a

6116
04:40:04,280 --> 04:40:07,200
collateral attack well of course Justice

6117
04:40:07,200 --> 04:40:09,160
bny deals with that as well and I'll

6118
04:40:09,160 --> 04:40:11,760
point you to that that's paragraph 6 63

6119
04:40:11,760 --> 04:40:16,080
to 65 of this decision and he notes that

6120
04:40:16,080 --> 04:40:18,638
uh justice borens very senior judge of

6121
04:40:18,638 --> 04:40:20,680
the court of appeal had noted properly

6122
04:40:20,680 --> 04:40:23,718
in tone that that that that collateral

6123
04:40:23,718 --> 04:40:26,000
attack defense is available at trial

6124
04:40:26,000 --> 04:40:27,840
that's not a that's not a defense for a

6125
04:40:27,840 --> 04:40:29,798
motion to strike that doesn't knock us

6126
04:40:29,798 --> 04:40:33,160
out of the box if if if the trial judge

6127
04:40:33,160 --> 04:40:35,440
after hearing all the evidence is

6128
04:40:35,440 --> 04:40:37,958
persuaded that uh that this really is

6129
04:40:37,958 --> 04:40:40,320
just a public law claimed dressed up as

6130
04:40:40,320 --> 04:40:43,878
a private law WR wrong uh he or she will

6131
04:40:43,878 --> 04:40:45,040
so

6132
04:40:45,040 --> 04:40:47,440
decide if additional damages should not

6133
04:40:47,440 --> 04:40:50,160
be awarded to Ronco that decision should

6134
04:40:50,160 --> 04:40:52,600
be made by this court in light of all

6135
04:40:52,600 --> 04:40:55,120
the evidence with proper Discovery and

6136
04:40:55,120 --> 04:40:58,040
proper testing of the

6137
04:40:58,638 --> 04:41:00,920
witnesses let's let Ronco get on with

6138
04:41:00,920 --> 04:41:05,000
its case as justice bny has uh has

6139
04:41:05,000 --> 04:41:07,520
urged uh where there's a wrong like

6140
04:41:07,520 --> 04:41:09,878
there like we say there's been a

6141
04:41:09,878 --> 04:41:13,638
wrong there need to be a meaningful

6142
04:41:13,638 --> 04:41:17,440
remedy so so your submissions are are

6143
04:41:17,440 --> 04:41:19,680
referring specifically to your general

6144
04:41:19,680 --> 04:41:21,920
damages claim at paragraph 1 a or 1B

6145
04:41:21,920 --> 04:41:24,280
sorry yes General damages are pleaded at

6146
04:41:24,280 --> 04:41:25,958
a million dollars I've taken you some of

6147
04:41:25,958 --> 04:41:28,600
Bings about lost business lost profits

6148
04:41:28,600 --> 04:41:30,680
they could be more you know a lot of

6149
04:41:30,680 --> 04:41:33,360
these things a lot of these things could

6150
04:41:33,360 --> 04:41:35,638
could be more or less particularized the

6151
04:41:35,638 --> 04:41:38,680
problem is a a deficiency in pleading

6152
04:41:38,680 --> 04:41:40,200
and if there is a deficiency in pleading

6153
04:41:40,200 --> 04:41:42,600
it's entirely my fault Justice B that

6154
04:41:42,600 --> 04:41:44,920
doesn't knock the cause of action and

6155
04:41:44,920 --> 04:41:49,200
Ronco out of the box it we told my

6156
04:41:49,200 --> 04:41:51,080
friends no particulars are required at

6157
04:41:51,080 --> 04:41:52,798
this time they don't disagree they agree

6158
04:41:52,798 --> 04:41:55,320
that's the law but they say well you

6159
04:41:55,320 --> 04:41:57,200
know that million dollars which could be

6160
04:41:57,200 --> 04:41:58,680
10 million I think I just said it could

6161
04:41:58,680 --> 04:42:00,840
be amended tomorrow to 10 million that

6162
04:42:00,840 --> 04:42:03,160
million dollars that's really not

6163
04:42:03,160 --> 04:42:05,440
properly a negligence claim or a public

6164
04:42:05,440 --> 04:42:09,320
law claim I say to you it is properly

6165
04:42:09,320 --> 04:42:11,840
and the trial judge at the end of

6166
04:42:11,840 --> 04:42:15,000
trial could will could and shall

6167
04:42:15,000 --> 04:42:17,280
determine this and as I said at the

6168
04:42:17,280 --> 04:42:20,520
outset right alongside this section 135

6169
04:42:20,520 --> 04:42:22,320
action Ronco could have commenced a

6170
04:42:22,320 --> 04:42:24,040
separate proceeding in negligence and

6171
04:42:24,040 --> 04:42:24,958
public

6172
04:42:24,958 --> 04:42:26,718
maladministration and my friends would

6173
04:42:26,718 --> 04:42:29,878
have nothing to say about that uh

6174
04:42:29,878 --> 04:42:31,360
proceeding I'm sure they would say

6175
04:42:31,360 --> 04:42:33,120
exactly what they're saying today but in

6176
04:42:33,120 --> 04:42:36,400
our respectful view uh the this Court's

6177
04:42:36,400 --> 04:42:38,400
jurist prudence and the court of appeal

6178
04:42:38,400 --> 04:42:40,798
in break would say look let's get on

6179
04:42:40,798 --> 04:42:43,360
with it as Justice bny's told us to do

6180
04:42:43,360 --> 04:42:46,240
let's uh let's consolidate these matters

6181
04:42:46,240 --> 04:42:48,360
we'll issue two decisions if we have to

6182
04:42:48,360 --> 04:42:51,680
let's get on with it all right so so

6183
04:42:51,680 --> 04:42:55,040
given that um given that uh there's

6184
04:42:55,040 --> 04:42:56,760
you've taken a position that one

6185
04:42:56,760 --> 04:42:59,480
paragraph 1A should be

6186
04:42:59,480 --> 04:43:03,480
struck why is one what what purpose does

6187
04:43:03,480 --> 04:43:04,840
1B

6188
04:43:04,840 --> 04:43:07,280
serve pardon me I'm just getting to it

6189
04:43:07,280 --> 04:43:09,840
so that's that's the 2.5 million claim

6190
04:43:09,840 --> 04:43:13,120
for penalties and tariffs and duties Etc

6191
04:43:13,120 --> 04:43:16,360
one a goes how does One D survive we say

6192
04:43:16,360 --> 04:43:19,200
those are Dam those are damages damages

6193
04:43:19,200 --> 04:43:22,958
that are caused by this this improper

6194
04:43:22,958 --> 04:43:24,958
maladministration this is this is a

6195
04:43:24,958 --> 04:43:26,958
measure of Damages

6196
04:43:26,958 --> 04:43:29,360
pleading my friends say you can't do it

6197
04:43:29,360 --> 04:43:31,000
because it's indirectly a collateral

6198
04:43:31,000 --> 04:43:32,680
attack that's may be available to them

6199
04:43:32,680 --> 04:43:34,840
at the end of the evidence but you can

6200
04:43:34,840 --> 04:43:37,240
imagine a situation not unlike let's

6201
04:43:37,240 --> 04:43:39,798
imagine it's a roncarelli situation

6202
04:43:39,798 --> 04:43:41,760
where Mr roncarelli is a Jehovah's

6203
04:43:41,760 --> 04:43:44,040
Witness it of course that wasn't the

6204
04:43:44,040 --> 04:43:47,200
reason but if it were these would be

6205
04:43:47,200 --> 04:43:50,240
part of the damages this is an issue let

6206
04:43:50,240 --> 04:43:51,920
let me then ask you this

6207
04:43:51,920 --> 04:43:55,280
question if this if this action is

6208
04:43:55,280 --> 04:43:57,200
allowed to

6209
04:43:57,200 --> 04:44:00,638
proceed it's certainly you you currently

6210
04:44:00,638 --> 04:44:02,200
have a matter that's being held in OB

6211
04:44:02,200 --> 04:44:03,840
bance before the

6212
04:44:03,840 --> 04:44:06,560
CIT an appeal before the CIT if that

6213
04:44:06,560 --> 04:44:09,080
appeal were to go ahead and you were

6214
04:44:09,080 --> 04:44:12,080
successful

6215
04:44:12,638 --> 04:44:15,798
and had been awarded damages here under

6216
04:44:15,798 --> 04:44:18,520
a head of damage but you were also

6217
04:44:18,520 --> 04:44:20,400
successful later on before the CIT

6218
04:44:20,400 --> 04:44:22,080
aren't you double indemnified then for

6219
04:44:22,080 --> 04:44:24,000
these duties and tariffs issues there's

6220
04:44:24,000 --> 04:44:26,638
no damages here there's there's a

6221
04:44:26,638 --> 04:44:28,718
payment as a result of an administrative

6222
04:44:28,718 --> 04:44:31,040
decision um that administrative decision

6223
04:44:31,040 --> 04:44:33,320
is is going to be dealt with other

6224
04:44:33,320 --> 04:44:36,000
elsewhere um the 1A pleading is coming

6225
04:44:36,000 --> 04:44:38,638
out as a result of what I understand to

6226
04:44:38,638 --> 04:44:40,040
be your position that you agree with

6227
04:44:40,040 --> 04:44:42,840
that how does the 1 D survive if if

6228
04:44:42,840 --> 04:44:44,560
that's a position you have with one with

6229
04:44:44,560 --> 04:44:45,440
one

6230
04:44:45,440 --> 04:44:48,000
a may I just have a minute I don't want

6231
04:44:48,000 --> 04:44:49,520
to trench also on what my friend is

6232
04:44:49,520 --> 04:44:55,000
gonna say so if I yeah absolutely yes

6233
04:45:21,360 --> 04:45:23,280
thank you thank you justice gon I I

6234
04:45:23,280 --> 04:45:24,920
don't want to trench too much on what my

6235
04:45:24,920 --> 04:45:26,080
friend is going to be talking to you

6236
04:45:26,080 --> 04:45:28,040
about but in essence these parallel

6237
04:45:28,040 --> 04:45:29,638
proceedings which you were quite right

6238
04:45:29,638 --> 04:45:31,200
to point out the possibility of

6239
04:45:31,200 --> 04:45:34,440
discordant uh results one is going to be

6240
04:45:34,440 --> 04:45:37,480
held in OB if the CIT proceeding is held

6241
04:45:37,480 --> 04:45:39,840
in abeyance until this action is

6242
04:45:39,840 --> 04:45:42,040
finished there's there's no chance of

6243
04:45:42,040 --> 04:45:45,440
double recovery is that there and it's

6244
04:45:45,440 --> 04:45:47,760
not the attempt of Ronco to seek double

6245
04:45:47,760 --> 04:45:50,120
recovery we were told first of all to

6246
04:45:50,120 --> 04:45:52,040
come to the federal court we did that

6247
04:45:52,040 --> 04:45:53,840
then we were told to go to judicial

6248
04:45:53,840 --> 04:45:55,400
review we've done that and asked to be

6249
04:45:55,400 --> 04:45:57,000
held in the bance then we were told to

6250
04:45:57,000 --> 04:45:58,680
go to the CIT we've done that and asked

6251
04:45:58,680 --> 04:46:00,680
to be held in OB bance the the intent

6252
04:46:00,680 --> 04:46:03,440
isn't to isn't to multiply recovery the

6253
04:46:03,440 --> 04:46:06,320
intent is to get these matters get on

6254
04:46:06,320 --> 04:46:08,718
with it as Justice Benny said but I

6255
04:46:08,718 --> 04:46:10,600
think I think my friend Mr triviso is

6256
04:46:10,600 --> 04:46:11,920
also going to be talking about this in

6257
04:46:11,920 --> 04:46:14,560
terms of in terms of his

6258
04:46:14,560 --> 04:46:17,120
arguments and and so so link to that and

6259
04:46:17,120 --> 04:46:19,440
perhaps this is something that uh that

6260
04:46:19,440 --> 04:46:21,760
uh that your colleague is going to to

6261
04:46:21,760 --> 04:46:25,120
address but but tone is tazone not

6262
04:46:25,120 --> 04:46:28,080
distinguished on the basis that there is

6263
04:46:28,080 --> 04:46:30,320
not a

6264
04:46:30,320 --> 04:46:33,320
legisla process that that's engaged in

6265
04:46:33,320 --> 04:46:36,280
tone here it's here your friend's

6266
04:46:36,280 --> 04:46:40,440
argument is that with respect to the to

6267
04:46:40,440 --> 04:46:41,958
the

6268
04:46:41,958 --> 04:46:43,718
assessment

6269
04:46:43,718 --> 04:46:46,080
decision there's a there's a process

6270
04:46:46,080 --> 04:46:48,360
prescribed in the act that requires you

6271
04:46:48,360 --> 04:46:50,718
to go through the through the president

6272
04:46:50,718 --> 04:46:53,200
to the CIT and ultimately to the court

6273
04:46:53,200 --> 04:46:57,520
of appeal and my understanding is that

6274
04:46:57,520 --> 04:46:59,320
you don't necessarily disagree with that

6275
04:46:59,320 --> 04:47:02,280
and that's why we're seeing paragraph 1A

6276
04:47:02,280 --> 04:47:04,360
come out of the pleading uh or you're

6277
04:47:04,360 --> 04:47:06,080
proposing to take it out and perhaps I'm

6278
04:47:06,080 --> 04:47:07,920
putting words in your mouse so if I am

6279
04:47:07,920 --> 04:47:09,520
please let me

6280
04:47:09,520 --> 04:47:15,240
know so is a legisla process um given

6281
04:47:15,240 --> 04:47:16,558
what the Supreme Court has said in

6282
04:47:16,558 --> 04:47:18,878
tazone I don't read anything in there

6283
04:47:18,878 --> 04:47:20,520
and perhaps you can point me to

6284
04:47:20,520 --> 04:47:23,000
somewhere where this issue is addressed

6285
04:47:23,000 --> 04:47:24,760
I see nothing in there that suggests

6286
04:47:24,760 --> 04:47:26,878
this whole notion of letting a party get

6287
04:47:26,878 --> 04:47:31,600
on with it allows the court to ignore

6288
04:47:31,600 --> 04:47:33,840
parliament's Direction with respect to

6289
04:47:33,840 --> 04:47:36,040
how appeals or or reviews or be

6290
04:47:36,040 --> 04:47:37,160
undertaken with respect to

6291
04:47:37,160 --> 04:47:39,160
administrative

6292
04:47:39,160 --> 04:47:41,520
decisions you're correct sir the the the

6293
04:47:41,520 --> 04:47:43,240
facts are are not analogous in that

6294
04:47:43,240 --> 04:47:44,840
regard there is not a there is not a

6295
04:47:44,840 --> 04:47:49,200
customs act kind of um Customs act kind

6296
04:47:49,200 --> 04:47:53,240
of um legislative scheme such as there

6297
04:47:53,240 --> 04:47:55,400
is in this case what we are saying

6298
04:47:55,400 --> 04:47:58,440
though is tazone is about access to

6299
04:47:58,440 --> 04:48:01,878
justice tazone is about doing away with

6300
04:48:01,878 --> 04:48:04,520
the separate silos

6301
04:48:04,520 --> 04:48:07,120
and and when my friend talks about the

6302
04:48:07,120 --> 04:48:09,680
estole argument and talks about uh

6303
04:48:09,680 --> 04:48:11,320
General damages more generally I think

6304
04:48:11,320 --> 04:48:13,760
it'll be clear why this is the most

6305
04:48:13,760 --> 04:48:16,240
efficient way this is what um Justice

6306
04:48:16,240 --> 04:48:17,958
Stratus talks about in the break

6307
04:48:17,958 --> 04:48:20,878
decision like there's all kinds of ways

6308
04:48:20,878 --> 04:48:23,080
that this can be heard but it needs to

6309
04:48:23,080 --> 04:48:26,080
be heard on a proper record with proper

6310
04:48:26,080 --> 04:48:27,638
Witnesses

6311
04:48:27,638 --> 04:48:30,798
Etc and again uh I'll I'll wait to hear

6312
04:48:30,798 --> 04:48:33,000
from your friend but but but but that's

6313
04:48:33,000 --> 04:48:34,360
certainly one of the challenges as I

6314
04:48:34,360 --> 04:48:36,360
look this at this matter is is

6315
04:48:36,360 --> 04:48:38,958
Parliament has described and prescribed

6316
04:48:38,958 --> 04:48:40,878
a mechanism

6317
04:48:40,878 --> 04:48:43,360
1 a seems to be part of that

6318
04:48:43,360 --> 04:48:46,878
mechanism um and I don't see how 1 D

6319
04:48:46,878 --> 04:48:48,680
doesn't fall within the scope of that as

6320
04:48:48,680 --> 04:48:51,920
well if you accept 1A how do you how do

6321
04:48:51,920 --> 04:48:53,680
you not take the position that 1D should

6322
04:48:53,680 --> 04:48:56,000
be struck from the amended statement of

6323
04:48:56,000 --> 04:48:59,240
claim and um and the notion of getting

6324
04:48:59,240 --> 04:49:02,920
on with it and and removing silos again

6325
04:49:02,920 --> 04:49:05,558
uh not something that's inconsistent

6326
04:49:05,558 --> 04:49:06,920
with with what I read in the jurist

6327
04:49:06,920 --> 04:49:08,480
Prudence but I haven't seen any jurist

6328
04:49:08,480 --> 04:49:09,798
Prudence that allows you to take that

6329
04:49:09,798 --> 04:49:12,600
approach to to to allow a court to

6330
04:49:12,600 --> 04:49:15,080
ignore the fact that Parliament has

6331
04:49:15,080 --> 04:49:16,680
prescribed the process if Parliament

6332
04:49:16,680 --> 04:49:19,240
decides there shall be multiple silad

6333
04:49:19,240 --> 04:49:22,440
processes certainly I'm I don't see

6334
04:49:22,440 --> 04:49:24,080
anything telone that allows the court to

6335
04:49:24,080 --> 04:49:26,080
ignore that if the court may not agree

6336
04:49:26,080 --> 04:49:28,718
with it the court may not like it the

6337
04:49:28,718 --> 04:49:31,360
parties may not like like it but if if

6338
04:49:31,360 --> 04:49:33,080
that's what this if that's the scheme

6339
04:49:33,080 --> 04:49:35,000
that's been enacted by Parliament I'm

6340
04:49:35,000 --> 04:49:36,920
not sure how those types of arguments

6341
04:49:36,920 --> 04:49:39,400
give the court the authority to override

6342
04:49:39,400 --> 04:49:42,080
the jurisdiction that's been been given

6343
04:49:42,080 --> 04:49:46,040
to these bodies by by Parliament and uh

6344
04:49:46,040 --> 04:49:47,558
so so again if you can help me out with

6345
04:49:47,558 --> 04:49:50,240
that or make it clear I've misunderstood

6346
04:49:50,240 --> 04:49:51,920
where things are going here then then

6347
04:49:51,920 --> 04:49:54,878
that would be helpful either you or uh

6348
04:49:54,878 --> 04:49:57,760
or Mr TR trono on his uh on his

6349
04:49:57,760 --> 04:50:00,200
submissions well we we take your point

6350
04:50:00,200 --> 04:50:03,480
and and and we we frankly in in trying

6351
04:50:03,480 --> 04:50:06,240
to obviate the need for this hearing we

6352
04:50:06,240 --> 04:50:07,798
wanted to get to my friends something

6353
04:50:07,798 --> 04:50:10,000
quickly if if if the court is of the

6354
04:50:10,000 --> 04:50:12,280
view that that paragraph 1D is equally

6355
04:50:12,280 --> 04:50:15,040
offensive we would there are ways to do

6356
04:50:15,040 --> 04:50:16,440
that without blowing this out of the

6357
04:50:16,440 --> 04:50:19,400
water um but I I take your point about

6358
04:50:19,400 --> 04:50:22,080
the the the legisla scheme and and I

6359
04:50:22,080 --> 04:50:23,798
think I will just defer the rest of

6360
04:50:23,798 --> 04:50:25,400
these comments to to my friend

6361
04:50:25,400 --> 04:50:27,878
submissions and that's fine thank you

6362
04:50:27,878 --> 04:50:29,520
thank you if I could just conclude

6363
04:50:29,520 --> 04:50:31,760
though and I will say tone is also about

6364
04:50:31,760 --> 04:50:34,360
access to Justice and it's not every

6365
04:50:34,360 --> 04:50:36,920
client it's not every litigant that that

6366
04:50:36,920 --> 04:50:40,360
has the resolve of Ronco you know Ronco

6367
04:50:40,360 --> 04:50:43,680
has has this this it is rare to hold the

6368
04:50:43,680 --> 04:50:46,040
Attorney General to account in the in

6369
04:50:46,040 --> 04:50:48,160
the manner in which Ronco has done so

6370
04:50:48,160 --> 04:50:50,320
and frankly I'm I'm proud that somebody

6371
04:50:50,320 --> 04:50:52,160
is trying to do so because most

6372
04:50:52,160 --> 04:50:54,400
litigants don't have the means and don't

6373
04:50:54,400 --> 04:50:56,240
have the you know the wherewithal to do

6374
04:50:56,240 --> 04:50:59,040
that and and that leads sort of to my

6375
04:50:59,040 --> 04:51:01,718
concluding remarks this this claim

6376
04:51:01,718 --> 04:51:03,400
should not be struck here today would

6377
04:51:03,400 --> 04:51:05,920
send a terrible terrible message it

6378
04:51:05,920 --> 04:51:07,360
would say that this court will not

6379
04:51:07,360 --> 04:51:10,000
review and if necessary correct the type

6380
04:51:10,000 --> 04:51:12,480
of behavior that is pleaded it would be

6381
04:51:12,480 --> 04:51:14,958
signaling to these government actors to

6382
04:51:14,958 --> 04:51:18,240
the cbsa to Mr ban to all of the cbsa

6383
04:51:18,240 --> 04:51:22,040
officials that are named that that there

6384
04:51:22,040 --> 04:51:23,400
the these actions will not be

6385
04:51:23,400 --> 04:51:25,320
meaningfully scrutinized and held to

6386
04:51:25,320 --> 04:51:27,920
account now in the past of course this

6387
04:51:27,920 --> 04:51:29,760
court the federal court trial division

6388
04:51:29,760 --> 04:51:32,600
has has that's been their role it has to

6389
04:51:32,600 --> 04:51:34,200
stand up to the attorney general of

6390
04:51:34,200 --> 04:51:36,200
Canada when the Attorney General Canada

6391
04:51:36,200 --> 04:51:37,840
has taken positions that don't Accord

6392
04:51:37,840 --> 04:51:39,878
with the rule of law that don't Accord

6393
04:51:39,878 --> 04:51:41,280
with the government's duty to the public

6394
04:51:41,280 --> 04:51:43,520
or to its statutory duties or to

6395
04:51:43,520 --> 04:51:45,520
principles of fairness and access to

6396
04:51:45,520 --> 04:51:47,680
Justice this tazone again is an access

6397
04:51:47,680 --> 04:51:49,718
to Justice case above

6398
04:51:49,718 --> 04:51:52,200
all I I know you're familiar with it so

6399
04:51:52,200 --> 04:51:54,120
I'll mention it the National Security

6400
04:51:54,120 --> 04:51:56,600
context it's not analogous but that's a

6401
04:51:56,600 --> 04:51:59,718
perfect example where this court has has

6402
04:51:59,718 --> 04:52:01,718
said to the attorney general of Canada

6403
04:52:01,718 --> 04:52:04,558
no you you got to stop you gotta you

6404
04:52:04,558 --> 04:52:06,878
have to uh you have to be held

6405
04:52:06,878 --> 04:52:09,480
accountable for your actions that that

6406
04:52:09,480 --> 04:52:11,680
is what this Court's Duty is and that is

6407
04:52:11,680 --> 04:52:14,240
the best feature of this court and it

6408
04:52:14,240 --> 04:52:16,718
also goes without saying Justice gleon

6409
04:52:16,718 --> 04:52:19,600
that by dismissing this motion my friend

6410
04:52:19,600 --> 04:52:21,120
the Attorney General's motion you aren't

6411
04:52:21,120 --> 04:52:24,120
saying that Ronco or the cbsa is right

6412
04:52:24,120 --> 04:52:26,798
or wrong what you are you're saying to

6413
04:52:26,798 --> 04:52:30,000
cbsa get ready to explain yourselves you

6414
04:52:30,000 --> 04:52:31,760
may have a very good explanation or you

6415
04:52:31,760 --> 04:52:33,958
may not and you're saying to Ronco get

6416
04:52:33,958 --> 04:52:36,080
ready to put your best foot forward they

6417
04:52:36,080 --> 04:52:37,878
Ronco has been ready for a while to do

6418
04:52:37,878 --> 04:52:42,280
that um tell this court how and why cbsa

6419
04:52:42,280 --> 04:52:44,798
actions have harmed you and harmed you

6420
04:52:44,798 --> 04:52:47,320
unfairly that's what this court does and

6421
04:52:47,320 --> 04:52:49,638
is the only person to do it because my

6422
04:52:49,638 --> 04:52:52,360
friends are trying to send Ronco with

6423
04:52:52,360 --> 04:52:55,240
due respect to three different places

6424
04:52:55,240 --> 04:52:58,280
none of which can do all of that so if

6425
04:52:58,280 --> 04:53:01,080
there aren't any more uh questions

6426
04:53:01,080 --> 04:53:02,920
Justice gleon I would turn that turn it

6427
04:53:02,920 --> 04:53:05,320
over to Mr triviso at this

6428
04:53:05,320 --> 04:53:07,600
point thank you very much Mr Baxter now

6429
04:53:07,600 --> 04:53:12,440
I've got no questions thank you Mr TR

6430
04:53:20,960 --> 04:53:23,878
[Music]

6431
04:53:23,878 --> 04:53:25,878
I I've taken a minute unmuting myself

6432
04:53:25,878 --> 04:53:27,520
because Mr bter and I are in the same

6433
04:53:27,520 --> 04:53:28,760
room and we didn't want to create an

6434
04:53:28,760 --> 04:53:30,680
echo for you which is always a danger in

6435
04:53:30,680 --> 04:53:31,480
these

6436
04:53:31,480 --> 04:53:33,440
proceedings I'm going to start by

6437
04:53:33,440 --> 04:53:35,320
briefly dealing with some of the

6438
04:53:35,320 --> 04:53:38,120
arguments around General damages and

6439
04:53:38,120 --> 04:53:40,718
damages for professional fees uh then

6440
04:53:40,718 --> 04:53:42,798
I'll move on to what seems to be the hot

6441
04:53:42,798 --> 04:53:45,600
button issue today which is questions of

6442
04:53:45,600 --> 04:53:48,080
jurisdiction the statutory process and

6443
04:53:48,080 --> 04:53:50,480
the section 1D that uh you've pointed

6444
04:53:50,480 --> 04:53:55,200
out um attached to that issue I will

6445
04:53:55,200 --> 04:53:57,680
also walk you through the estole

6446
04:53:57,680 --> 04:53:59,638
argument for why we say that the

6447
04:53:59,638 --> 04:54:02,000
Attorney General cannot make the

6448
04:54:02,000 --> 04:54:03,878
jurisdiction arguments that it attempts

6449
04:54:03,878 --> 04:54:05,920
to make today given the clear and

6450
04:54:05,920 --> 04:54:08,440
unambiguous representations previously

6451
04:54:08,440 --> 04:54:10,520
made by the cbsa

6452
04:54:10,520 --> 04:54:12,600
I then want to speak to the dangers of

6453
04:54:12,600 --> 04:54:16,040
multiple proceedings and uh lastly I

6454
04:54:16,040 --> 04:54:18,920
will come back to the interpretation of

6455
04:54:18,920 --> 04:54:21,360
reason to believe and briefly touch on

6456
04:54:21,360 --> 04:54:24,120
what its significance is although uh

6457
04:54:24,120 --> 04:54:25,920
that should not be determinative on a

6458
04:54:25,920 --> 04:54:28,160
motion to strike and I think Mr nosac is

6459
04:54:28,160 --> 04:54:30,000
in agreement with that as

6460
04:54:30,000 --> 04:54:34,360
well so briefly on General damages Mr

6461
04:54:34,360 --> 04:54:36,760
Baxter just took you to the paragraphs

6462
04:54:36,760 --> 04:54:38,718
of our statement of claim in paragraphs

6463
04:54:38,718 --> 04:54:41,920
14 to 17 that articulate some of the

6464
04:54:41,920 --> 04:54:44,160
particulars of the effect on Ron's

6465
04:54:44,160 --> 04:54:47,040
business as a result of the conduct uh

6466
04:54:47,040 --> 04:54:49,958
that we allege in our statement of claim

6467
04:54:49,958 --> 04:54:55,400
uh importantly though for um

6468
04:54:55,400 --> 04:54:58,760
uh topic of a motion to strike the

6469
04:54:58,760 --> 04:55:01,878
defendants have not cited a single case

6470
04:55:01,878 --> 04:55:03,798
where a plaintiff's claim has been

6471
04:55:03,798 --> 04:55:06,440
struck for a failure to plead General

6472
04:55:06,440 --> 04:55:09,558
damages or a single case where a general

6473
04:55:09,558 --> 04:55:11,600
damage is claimed has been has been

6474
04:55:11,600 --> 04:55:13,558
struck for for a failure to plead those

6475
04:55:13,558 --> 04:55:16,280
damages and as such there's there's no

6476
04:55:16,280 --> 04:55:18,878
legal basis to strike Ronco General

6477
04:55:18,878 --> 04:55:21,638
damages claims here and and that's

6478
04:55:21,638 --> 04:55:24,718
because General damages are of a general

6479
04:55:24,718 --> 04:55:26,920
nature they do not need to be

6480
04:55:26,920 --> 04:55:30,000
particularized at the pleading stage uh

6481
04:55:30,000 --> 04:55:32,440
it is a matter for Discovery I know I

6482
04:55:32,440 --> 04:55:34,718
know Mr Mayor said earlier today that he

6483
04:55:34,718 --> 04:55:37,160
has a lot of questions about our general

6484
04:55:37,160 --> 04:55:39,240
damages claim and and those are

6485
04:55:39,240 --> 04:55:41,320
questions that he can Fair rais in

6486
04:55:41,320 --> 04:55:43,840
Discovery and I I do think that uh the

6487
04:55:43,840 --> 04:55:46,680
Attorney General accepts that uh we

6488
04:55:46,680 --> 04:55:48,920
don't have to particularize at this

6489
04:55:48,920 --> 04:55:52,718
stage um we've cited the uh governor and

6490
04:55:52,718 --> 04:55:55,120
Company of Adventures case at tab eight

6491
04:55:55,120 --> 04:55:57,280
of our book of authorities I won't take

6492
04:55:57,280 --> 04:55:59,360
you there but that was in the context of

6493
04:55:59,360 --> 04:56:01,840
a motion for particulars where the judge

6494
04:56:01,840 --> 04:56:03,920
made very clear that at the pleading

6495
04:56:03,920 --> 04:56:06,680
stage it is not necessary to

6496
04:56:06,680 --> 04:56:09,400
particularize a general damages claim

6497
04:56:09,400 --> 04:56:12,280
and to be very clear as as I understand

6498
04:56:12,280 --> 04:56:15,320
it there's there's no argument before

6499
04:56:15,320 --> 04:56:19,558
you today that the defendants um uh uh

6500
04:56:19,558 --> 04:56:21,760
or that General damages are not

6501
04:56:21,760 --> 04:56:24,000
available to the defendants as a matter

6502
04:56:24,000 --> 04:56:26,760
of law there's no suggestion that

6503
04:56:26,760 --> 04:56:28,638
General damages can't result from a

6504
04:56:28,638 --> 04:56:31,200
negligence claim or the general damages

6505
04:56:31,200 --> 04:56:34,920
cannot result from a parody honey style

6506
04:56:34,920 --> 04:56:39,360
Public Law claim uh it's just an issue

6507
04:56:39,360 --> 04:56:40,840
of how close mostly we have

6508
04:56:40,840 --> 04:56:43,160
particularized those General damages and

6509
04:56:43,160 --> 04:56:45,600
I think as Mr Baxter showed you earlier

6510
04:56:45,600 --> 04:56:47,840
we have fled General damages properly

6511
04:56:47,840 --> 04:56:50,080
and there's no legal basis to strike the

6512
04:56:50,080 --> 04:56:52,520
general damages

6513
04:56:52,520 --> 04:56:55,638
claim I I'll deal briefly as well with

6514
04:56:55,638 --> 04:56:58,600
the question of the damages that Ronco

6515
04:56:58,600 --> 04:57:01,958
seeks for uh certain professional fees

6516
04:57:01,958 --> 04:57:06,280
incurred and Ronco seeks those damages

6517
04:57:06,280 --> 04:57:08,840
on the basis that those professional uh

6518
04:57:08,840 --> 04:57:11,280
fees which were occurred throughout this

6519
04:57:11,280 --> 04:57:15,080
entire process of appeals um with

6520
04:57:15,080 --> 04:57:19,718
cbsa um our position is that those fees

6521
04:57:19,718 --> 04:57:23,080
result from the conduct of the cbsa that

6522
04:57:23,080 --> 04:57:26,760
we say is negligent and that we say

6523
04:57:26,760 --> 04:57:29,840
constitutes a maladministration under a

6524
04:57:29,840 --> 04:57:32,680
public law claim and courts have

6525
04:57:32,680 --> 04:57:35,160
regularly awarded professional fees

6526
04:57:35,160 --> 04:57:37,120
incurred as a result of a defendant's

6527
04:57:37,120 --> 04:57:40,480
negligence or other tortous conduct uh

6528
04:57:40,480 --> 04:57:43,320
We've cited a number of cases where that

6529
04:57:43,320 --> 04:57:45,000
uh where those kinds of Damages have

6530
04:57:45,000 --> 04:57:48,000
been awarded I I won't take you to them

6531
04:57:48,000 --> 04:57:50,320
all I'll just reference them for you but

6532
04:57:50,320 --> 04:57:52,840
there's the Granville savings case

6533
04:57:52,840 --> 04:57:55,080
Supreme Court case at tab n of our book

6534
04:57:55,080 --> 04:57:59,080
of authorities there's the tesy case at

6535
04:57:59,080 --> 04:58:01,718
tab 15 of our book of authorities and

6536
04:58:01,718 --> 04:58:04,480
the Beckstead case at Tab four of our

6537
04:58:04,480 --> 04:58:05,558
book of

6538
04:58:05,558 --> 04:58:09,080
authorities these are simply pecuniary

6539
04:58:09,080 --> 04:58:12,638
damages that that we say were caused by

6540
04:58:12,638 --> 04:58:15,160
the defendant's conduct but for the

6541
04:58:15,160 --> 04:58:18,240
defendant's conduct Ronco would not have

6542
04:58:18,240 --> 04:58:20,760
incurred these fees and therefore they

6543
04:58:20,760 --> 04:58:24,558
should be reimbursed as damages now I I

6544
04:58:24,558 --> 04:58:27,280
heard Mr may this morning expressed some

6545
04:58:27,280 --> 04:58:29,160
concerns about whether these

6546
04:58:29,160 --> 04:58:31,160
professional fees were actually caused

6547
04:58:31,160 --> 04:58:34,638
by cbsa conduct or not and again that is

6548
04:58:34,638 --> 04:58:37,320
a that is a fair defense for the

6549
04:58:37,320 --> 04:58:39,718
defendants to raise a trial questions of

6550
04:58:39,718 --> 04:58:41,160
cause

6551
04:58:41,160 --> 04:58:44,040
but it is not an issue to be decided

6552
04:58:44,040 --> 04:58:46,400
without any evidence at the pleading

6553
04:58:46,400 --> 04:58:48,400
stage on a motion to

6554
04:58:48,400 --> 04:58:51,160
strike um similarly there may be

6555
04:58:51,160 --> 04:58:52,360
questions about whether these were

6556
04:58:52,360 --> 04:58:55,400
Quantified properly but again that's a

6557
04:58:55,400 --> 04:59:00,120
defense to be raised at trial on the

6558
04:59:00,120 --> 04:59:03,240
evidence again like with the uh

6559
04:59:03,240 --> 04:59:06,040
arguments around General damages the

6560
04:59:06,040 --> 04:59:09,480
defendants have not cited a single case

6561
04:59:09,480 --> 04:59:12,240
where a claim for professional fees Was

6562
04:59:12,240 --> 04:59:14,400
Defeated on a motion to strike

6563
04:59:14,400 --> 04:59:16,440
specifically because of the nature of

6564
04:59:16,440 --> 04:59:19,360
the professional fees claim the the one

6565
04:59:19,360 --> 04:59:22,558
decision that Mr May uh mayor pointed

6566
04:59:22,558 --> 04:59:27,320
you to this morning was the jco case and

6567
04:59:27,320 --> 04:59:30,520
that jco case was decided on the basis

6568
04:59:30,520 --> 04:59:33,878
of Duty of care right that there was a

6569
04:59:33,878 --> 04:59:36,558
finding by Justice Meyers that he was

6570
04:59:36,558 --> 04:59:41,558
bound by star decisis of um uh uh other

6571
04:59:41,558 --> 04:59:44,440
Superior Courts in Ontario that he could

6572
04:59:44,440 --> 04:59:47,000
not recognize a duty of care and that's

6573
04:59:47,000 --> 04:59:49,040
why the damages claimed there could not

6574
04:59:49,040 --> 04:59:51,000
move forward but it wasn't because of

6575
04:59:51,000 --> 04:59:53,718
the nature of a damages claim for

6576
04:59:53,718 --> 04:59:55,040
professional

6577
04:59:55,040 --> 04:59:58,160
fees um so our submission is that there

6578
04:59:58,160 --> 05:00:01,120
is no legal basis for you to strike that

6579
05:00:01,120 --> 05:00:04,120
part of Ron's

6580
05:00:07,480 --> 05:00:12,600
claim moving on to um jurisdiction and

6581
05:00:12,600 --> 05:00:15,480
as as Mr Baxter said to earlier we we

6582
05:00:15,480 --> 05:00:17,798
don't think jurisdiction should be an

6583
05:00:17,798 --> 05:00:21,280
issue any longer and uh We've made very

6584
05:00:21,280 --> 05:00:23,558
clear that section 1A is no longer an

6585
05:00:23,558 --> 05:00:26,840
issue we've been through that a few

6586
05:00:26,840 --> 05:00:32,440
times I do want to um clarify what it is

6587
05:00:32,440 --> 05:00:35,240
I understand the defendants are arguing

6588
05:00:35,240 --> 05:00:37,718
with respect to jurisdiction and what I

6589
05:00:37,718 --> 05:00:40,558
don't think they are arguing

6590
05:00:40,558 --> 05:00:42,718
there's no argument by the defendants

6591
05:00:42,718 --> 05:00:44,160
that this court doesn't have

6592
05:00:44,160 --> 05:00:46,760
jurisdiction to hear Ron's negligence

6593
05:00:46,760 --> 05:00:49,160
claim there's no argument that this

6594
05:00:49,160 --> 05:00:51,760
court doesn't have jurisdiction to hear

6595
05:00:51,760 --> 05:00:54,718
a parody honey claim and there's no

6596
05:00:54,718 --> 05:00:57,878
argument that damages cannot normally be

6597
05:00:57,878 --> 05:01:01,280
sought uh uh for those kinds of claims

6598
05:01:01,280 --> 05:01:03,520
no no no argument that that's not within

6599
05:01:03,520 --> 05:01:06,480
the jurisdiction of this court and

6600
05:01:06,480 --> 05:01:09,080
there's no argument that the Customs act

6601
05:01:09,080 --> 05:01:12,040
has ousted this Court's Jurisdiction to

6602
05:01:12,040 --> 05:01:14,680
hear any of those sorts of claims it

6603
05:01:14,680 --> 05:01:17,280
really is a question that relates to

6604
05:01:17,280 --> 05:01:20,320
damages and as as justice gleon as you

6605
05:01:20,320 --> 05:01:22,680
pointed out how those damages are

6606
05:01:22,680 --> 05:01:25,120
Quantified and let me take you through

6607
05:01:25,120 --> 05:01:27,680
all of that uh there was some reference

6608
05:01:27,680 --> 05:01:32,000
to the fritz and Sketchers uh cases this

6609
05:01:32,000 --> 05:01:35,440
morning but neither of those cases speak

6610
05:01:35,440 --> 05:01:37,760
to the federal Court's Jurisdiction to

6611
05:01:37,760 --> 05:01:40,638
Grant damages in a negligence case or to

6612
05:01:40,638 --> 05:01:43,638
Grant to award damages in a parody honey

6613
05:01:43,638 --> 05:01:44,680
style

6614
05:01:44,680 --> 05:01:47,280
claim now the arguments that the

6615
05:01:47,280 --> 05:01:49,958
defendants raise around

6616
05:01:49,958 --> 05:01:52,240
jurisdiction and

6617
05:01:52,240 --> 05:01:56,160
damages um they they have not cited a

6618
05:01:56,160 --> 05:01:58,000
single case that stands for the

6619
05:01:58,000 --> 05:02:00,360
proposition that this court doesn't have

6620
05:02:00,360 --> 05:02:02,798
jurisdiction to award the kinds of

6621
05:02:02,798 --> 05:02:06,160
Damages that Ronco that Ronco seeks in

6622
05:02:06,160 --> 05:02:09,200
my view and I think their argument in

6623
05:02:09,200 --> 05:02:12,080
expressing this as a jurisdiction

6624
05:02:12,080 --> 05:02:14,080
argument I believe that it

6625
05:02:14,080 --> 05:02:17,440
misunderstands the underlying case law

6626
05:02:17,440 --> 05:02:20,000
and the the case that they cite too is

6627
05:02:20,000 --> 05:02:22,320
the same case that Mr Baxter and I have

6628
05:02:22,320 --> 05:02:23,958
been relying on quite a bit in this

6629
05:02:23,958 --> 05:02:26,480
hearing and that's the tesone case and

6630
05:02:26,480 --> 05:02:28,280
obviously we see the case quite

6631
05:02:28,280 --> 05:02:33,480
differently and I will take you to um uh

6632
05:02:33,480 --> 05:02:38,520
paragraph 78 of tazone Tone's at tab six

6633
05:02:38,520 --> 05:02:41,798
of our book of authority

6634
05:02:42,120 --> 05:02:44,680
but this is the paragraph they site for

6635
05:02:44,680 --> 05:02:46,958
the proposition that this court doesn't

6636
05:02:46,958 --> 05:02:47,878
have

6637
05:02:47,878 --> 05:02:50,480
jurisdiction and this is a paragraph

6638
05:02:50,480 --> 05:02:53,280
about residual discretion it says there

6639
05:02:53,280 --> 05:02:55,600
is always a residual discretion in the

6640
05:02:55,600 --> 05:02:58,200
inherent jurisdiction of the superior

6641
05:02:58,200 --> 05:03:00,878
court and the federal court to stay the

6642
05:03:00,878 --> 05:03:03,080
damages claimed because in its essential

6643
05:03:03,080 --> 05:03:05,840
character is a claim for judicial review

6644
05:03:05,840 --> 05:03:08,040
with only a thin pretense to a private

6645
05:03:08,040 --> 05:03:10,798
wrong so again this is about residual

6646
05:03:10,798 --> 05:03:13,440
discretion it's not about there being no

6647
05:03:13,440 --> 05:03:15,760
jurisdiction to hear a damages claim in

6648
05:03:15,760 --> 05:03:17,000
the federal

6649
05:03:17,000 --> 05:03:21,600
court um and then it the the the the

6650
05:03:21,600 --> 05:03:24,680
same sentence in the same breath uh Jus

6651
05:03:24,680 --> 05:03:27,000
as B emphasized that really the question

6652
05:03:27,000 --> 05:03:28,718
is whether there's a reasonable private

6653
05:03:28,718 --> 05:03:30,520
cause of action for damages which has

6654
05:03:30,520 --> 05:03:32,878
been pled and our submission is of

6655
05:03:32,878 --> 05:03:35,000
course that that private cause of action

6656
05:03:35,000 --> 05:03:37,680
has been pled just as it was in tazone

6657
05:03:37,680 --> 05:03:39,920
and as such we should be allowed to get

6658
05:03:39,920 --> 05:03:42,320
on with

6659
05:03:43,840 --> 05:03:46,600
it and and that's where our claim is

6660
05:03:46,600 --> 05:03:49,040
similar to tone in that the damages that

6661
05:03:49,040 --> 05:03:51,240
we're seeking the general damages the

6662
05:03:51,240 --> 05:03:53,280
professional fees and the amount

6663
05:03:53,280 --> 05:03:56,718
Quantified in the amount of the um uh of

6664
05:03:56,718 --> 05:03:59,920
the duties all of those flow from the

6665
05:03:59,920 --> 05:04:02,400
conduct of cbsa and we should be able to

6666
05:04:02,400 --> 05:04:05,000
pursue them and I'm I'm going to come to

6667
05:04:05,000 --> 05:04:07,080
your question Justice Gleason about the

6668
05:04:07,080 --> 05:04:10,120
statutory process I think before we do

6669
05:04:10,120 --> 05:04:12,360
that it would be instructive to review

6670
05:04:12,360 --> 05:04:14,680
two of the cases that my friend cite to

6671
05:04:14,680 --> 05:04:17,400
this morning that apply this paragraph

6672
05:04:17,400 --> 05:04:21,638
in tone and that's the Leon case and the

6673
05:04:21,638 --> 05:04:26,400
Stewart case Leon is at volume two tab

6674
05:04:26,400 --> 05:04:32,040
34 of um uh of the defendant's book of

6675
05:04:32,040 --> 05:04:35,160
authorities again neither of these cases

6676
05:04:35,160 --> 05:04:37,878
are dealing with questions of

6677
05:04:37,878 --> 05:04:40,200
jurisdiction over damag

6678
05:04:40,200 --> 05:04:42,600
claims that's that's not what these

6679
05:04:42,600 --> 05:04:44,440
courts are doing when they ex when they

6680
05:04:44,440 --> 05:04:47,080
exercise their residual discretion under

6681
05:04:47,080 --> 05:04:51,520
tesone so in the um the Leon case this

6682
05:04:51,520 --> 05:04:53,600
is a case where a federal inmate had

6683
05:04:53,600 --> 05:04:56,558
brought an action on the basis of a a

6684
05:04:56,558 --> 05:04:58,558
sech charge that was charged against

6685
05:04:58,558 --> 05:04:59,920
their pum

6686
05:04:59,920 --> 05:05:04,000
allowance uh the plaintiff um uh alleged

6687
05:05:04,000 --> 05:05:05,600
that this was a breach of the

6688
05:05:05,600 --> 05:05:08,558
corrections and conditional release act

6689
05:05:08,558 --> 05:05:11,280
and in paragraph 22 this is where the

6690
05:05:11,280 --> 05:05:13,878
court applies its residual discretion in

6691
05:05:13,878 --> 05:05:17,680
pelone and the court says I find that a

6692
05:05:17,680 --> 05:05:19,520
breach of section

6693
05:05:19,520 --> 05:05:22,320
76 of the corrections in conditional

6694
05:05:22,320 --> 05:05:25,520
release Act is not a reasonable cause of

6695
05:05:25,520 --> 05:05:28,440
action so this is the court saying you

6696
05:05:28,440 --> 05:05:31,520
you can't just claim the breach of a

6697
05:05:31,520 --> 05:05:35,400
statute and and make that a cause of

6698
05:05:35,400 --> 05:05:37,840
action that's how tesone is being

6699
05:05:37,840 --> 05:05:39,718
applied in this case it's not looking at

6700
05:05:39,718 --> 05:05:41,798
at the negligence claim it's not looking

6701
05:05:41,798 --> 05:05:44,120
at the damages sought it's just saying

6702
05:05:44,120 --> 05:05:46,280
you you can't make up a cause of action

6703
05:05:46,280 --> 05:05:49,480
that's just grounded in statutory breach

6704
05:05:49,480 --> 05:05:53,400
that is the kind of um Public Law claim

6705
05:05:53,400 --> 05:05:55,760
dressed up as a private law claim that

6706
05:05:55,760 --> 05:05:59,240
can be struck under tesone

6707
05:05:59,240 --> 05:06:02,240
and Leon is quite instructive because

6708
05:06:02,240 --> 05:06:04,240
the plaintiff actually had pled a

6709
05:06:04,240 --> 05:06:06,680
negligence claim in that case and the

6710
05:06:06,680 --> 05:06:08,680
negligence claim is not struck on the

6711
05:06:08,680 --> 05:06:10,360
basis of Tel

6712
05:06:10,360 --> 05:06:12,320
the negligence claim was struck on the

6713
05:06:12,320 --> 05:06:14,558
basis that the plaintiff had not

6714
05:06:14,558 --> 05:06:16,558
properly pled the material facts

6715
05:06:16,558 --> 05:06:19,160
underlying a claim and negligence this

6716
05:06:19,160 --> 05:06:21,120
is at paragraph

6717
05:06:21,120 --> 05:06:25,718
35 uh just just so you can see it but

6718
05:06:25,718 --> 05:06:27,280
the court found that the pleadings

6719
05:06:27,280 --> 05:06:29,080
around negligence were merely bald

6720
05:06:29,080 --> 05:06:31,440
assertions and I think Mr Baxter has

6721
05:06:31,440 --> 05:06:33,000
made very clear that our pleadings

6722
05:06:33,000 --> 05:06:35,120
around negligence are not merely bald

6723
05:06:35,120 --> 05:06:37,480
assertions and I don't think there is

6724
05:06:37,480 --> 05:06:39,200
any argument being Advanced by the

6725
05:06:39,200 --> 05:06:41,520
defend today that we failed to plead

6726
05:06:41,520 --> 05:06:43,638
material facts that ground a negligence

6727
05:06:43,638 --> 05:06:45,760
claim there's some discussion about

6728
05:06:45,760 --> 05:06:47,280
whether there's a duty of care here

6729
05:06:47,280 --> 05:06:50,000
today and Mr Baxter has addressed why

6730
05:06:50,000 --> 05:06:53,520
that's uh why why why there should be uh

6731
05:06:53,520 --> 05:06:55,920
or why a duty of care or why we should

6732
05:06:55,920 --> 05:06:57,958
be found to have properly pled a duty of

6733
05:06:57,958 --> 05:06:59,680
care and that's not a basis to strike a

6734
05:06:59,680 --> 05:07:02,360
claim but what this case is illustrative

6735
05:07:02,360 --> 05:07:05,280
of is this this whole question of

6736
05:07:05,280 --> 05:07:07,718
exercising the residual discretion in

6737
05:07:07,718 --> 05:07:09,760
tesone the way it's been applied in the

6738
05:07:09,760 --> 05:07:12,680
courts has not been to strike a damages

6739
05:07:12,680 --> 05:07:16,280
claim like the one that Ronco

6740
05:07:16,280 --> 05:07:20,240
seeks the the other um uh case that the

6741
05:07:20,240 --> 05:07:23,000
Attorney General cites where this tesone

6742
05:07:23,000 --> 05:07:25,680
residual discretion has been exercised

6743
05:07:25,680 --> 05:07:29,080
is the Stewart and Canada case at toab

6744
05:07:29,080 --> 05:07:33,280
50 of the uh uh defendants book of

6745
05:07:33,280 --> 05:07:35,680
authorities and that's a that's a very

6746
05:07:35,680 --> 05:07:38,200
strange case the the plaintiff had

6747
05:07:38,200 --> 05:07:41,000
alleged in that case that the crown and

6748
05:07:41,000 --> 05:07:42,520
the Attorney General of the United

6749
05:07:42,520 --> 05:07:45,760
States had conspired together to limit

6750
05:07:45,760 --> 05:07:49,320
the plaintiff's um presence in Canada

6751
05:07:49,320 --> 05:07:51,200
there were Charter breaches alleged

6752
05:07:51,200 --> 05:07:53,558
alleged there was a Mis fance in public

6753
05:07:53,558 --> 05:07:56,080
office claim there was a defamation

6754
05:07:56,080 --> 05:07:59,160
claim but again this case is not about

6755
05:07:59,160 --> 05:08:02,600
jurisdiction over damages claims the

6756
05:08:02,600 --> 05:08:08,040
plaintiff sought a uh quite novel

6757
05:08:08,040 --> 05:08:12,638
order uh at section or at paragraph 7 C

6758
05:08:12,638 --> 05:08:15,638
it's described in the case the plaintiff

6759
05:08:15,638 --> 05:08:18,080
was looking for an order to be allowed

6760
05:08:18,080 --> 05:08:20,600
to remain in Canada for the duration of

6761
05:08:20,600 --> 05:08:21,520
these

6762
05:08:21,520 --> 05:08:24,638
proceedings right it's this portion of

6763
05:08:24,638 --> 05:08:26,958
the claim that the judge used the

6764
05:08:26,958 --> 05:08:29,240
residual discretion from tesone to

6765
05:08:29,240 --> 05:08:31,240
strike and that's clear at the

6766
05:08:31,240 --> 05:08:32,920
paragraphs that the Attorney General

6767
05:08:32,920 --> 05:08:36,280
cites which are down at paragraph 59 and

6768
05:08:36,280 --> 05:08:39,440
60 you'll see paragraph 59 as the

6769
05:08:39,440 --> 05:08:41,558
reference to that language and tone that

6770
05:08:41,558 --> 05:08:43,718
I took you to earlier and then in

6771
05:08:43,718 --> 05:08:45,760
section or in paragraph 60 the court

6772
05:08:45,760 --> 05:08:47,920
says well in so far as the plaintiff

6773
05:08:47,920 --> 05:08:49,840
complains about the period of time for

6774
05:08:49,840 --> 05:08:51,360
which he was granted permission to stay

6775
05:08:51,360 --> 05:08:54,200
in Canada I agree with the arguments of

6776
05:08:54,200 --> 05:08:55,718
the defendants that the complainant may

6777
05:08:55,718 --> 05:08:57,798
be able or may be the subject of an

6778
05:08:57,798 --> 05:09:00,040
application for judicial review pursuant

6779
05:09:00,040 --> 05:09:01,400
to the provisions of the immigration and

6780
05:09:01,400 --> 05:09:03,440
Refugee protections act and then the

6781
05:09:03,440 --> 05:09:06,280
court strikes that portion of the claim

6782
05:09:06,280 --> 05:09:10,160
on the basis of telone

6783
05:09:10,680 --> 05:09:13,000
those are the cases that the attorney

6784
05:09:13,000 --> 05:09:15,840
general has put before you today on

6785
05:09:15,840 --> 05:09:18,920
exercising the residual discretion under

6786
05:09:18,920 --> 05:09:22,080
tesone to strike a portion of a claim

6787
05:09:22,080 --> 05:09:24,200
because it's merely a private law cause

6788
05:09:24,200 --> 05:09:27,040
of action or a public law a public law

6789
05:09:27,040 --> 05:09:29,120
claim that's dressed up as a private law

6790
05:09:29,120 --> 05:09:30,440
cause of

6791
05:09:30,440 --> 05:09:33,160
action none of those cases are on point

6792
05:09:33,160 --> 05:09:35,000
and none of those cases deal with a

6793
05:09:35,000 --> 05:09:38,160
damages claim like Ron

6794
05:09:38,160 --> 05:09:42,718
Ronco this case is much more like tazone

6795
05:09:42,718 --> 05:09:46,120
um as Mr Baxter explained to you before

6796
05:09:46,120 --> 05:09:52,878
tazone was about um uh uh uh was about

6797
05:09:52,878 --> 05:09:55,760
um the uh

6798
05:09:55,760 --> 05:09:58,798
um it was about the various silos that

6799
05:09:58,798 --> 05:10:00,840
the uh government said that the uh

6800
05:10:00,840 --> 05:10:03,000
claims should be in judicial review

6801
05:10:03,000 --> 05:10:05,160
should be pursued before seeking damages

6802
05:10:05,160 --> 05:10:09,600
in the superior court and um uh uh Mr

6803
05:10:09,600 --> 05:10:11,718
Baxter emphasized the importance of that

6804
05:10:11,718 --> 05:10:14,280
case as a case about access to Justice

6805
05:10:14,280 --> 05:10:17,520
and I I would just commend paragraph 18

6806
05:10:17,520 --> 05:10:20,920
of that decision as well which you you

6807
05:10:20,920 --> 05:10:23,440
may already be familiar with but this is

6808
05:10:23,440 --> 05:10:24,958
where Justice bnie says this is

6809
05:10:24,958 --> 05:10:27,520
fundamentally about access to Justice

6810
05:10:27,520 --> 05:10:29,080
people who claim to be injured by

6811
05:10:29,080 --> 05:10:30,680
government action should have whatever

6812
05:10:30,680 --> 05:10:32,638
redress the legal system permits through

6813
05:10:32,638 --> 05:10:35,040
the procedures that minimize unnecessary

6814
05:10:35,040 --> 05:10:37,600
cost and complexity the Court's approach

6815
05:10:37,600 --> 05:10:40,200
should be practical and preg Matic with

6816
05:10:40,200 --> 05:10:42,558
that objective in mind and that's the

6817
05:10:42,558 --> 05:10:44,920
approach that we're trying to take today

6818
05:10:44,920 --> 05:10:46,000
and that's the approach that we're

6819
05:10:46,000 --> 05:10:50,000
trying to take in this action um our

6820
05:10:50,000 --> 05:10:52,920
view is that the defendants jurisdiction

6821
05:10:52,920 --> 05:10:56,240
arguments are a way of over complicating

6822
05:10:56,240 --> 05:10:58,638
the necessary proceedings suggesting

6823
05:10:58,638 --> 05:11:00,840
that this court does not have

6824
05:11:00,840 --> 05:11:03,718
jurisdiction and on the basis of tone

6825
05:11:03,718 --> 05:11:05,718
taking that pragmatic and practical

6826
05:11:05,718 --> 05:11:08,798
approach uh the court should reject um

6827
05:11:08,798 --> 05:11:11,680
uh that argument and I I don't want to

6828
05:11:11,680 --> 05:11:13,878
create a a moment of suspense but I

6829
05:11:13,878 --> 05:11:16,040
wonder Justice gleon I'm about to get

6830
05:11:16,040 --> 05:11:18,520
into um uh the question that I think is

6831
05:11:18,520 --> 05:11:20,680
on your mind around a statutory process

6832
05:11:20,680 --> 05:11:23,480
and what can be done in the CIT I wonder

6833
05:11:23,480 --> 05:11:25,558
if now would be a natural point for a

6834
05:11:25,558 --> 05:11:27,920
short

6835
05:11:31,240 --> 05:11:34,600
break I think that's a a good idea we've

6836
05:11:34,600 --> 05:11:35,878
been going for over an hour and a half

6837
05:11:35,878 --> 05:11:38,958
now so so let's break um is uh 10

6838
05:11:38,958 --> 05:11:41,000
minutes enough just given the time of

6839
05:11:41,000 --> 05:11:43,600
the day everybody's noding yes okay so

6840
05:11:43,600 --> 05:11:45,000
we'll break for 10 minutes we'll come

6841
05:11:45,000 --> 05:11:50,638
back at uh at uh at 350 thank

6842
05:11:50,638 --> 05:11:55,000
you okay uh this uh special sitting of

6843
05:11:55,000 --> 05:12:00,000
the federal court is now in recess until

6844
05:12:00,958 --> 05:12:03,080
350 all

6845
05:12:03,080 --> 05:12:06,958
right the court is now

6846
05:12:06,958 --> 05:12:09,280
resumed all right I think we're probably

6847
05:12:09,280 --> 05:12:11,440
ready to go again Mr trano I can

6848
05:12:11,440 --> 05:12:14,400
actually see you you were you were uh I

6849
05:12:14,400 --> 05:12:16,280
thought it was my perhaps my camera my

6850
05:12:16,280 --> 05:12:19,878
screen but you were quite uh quite foggy

6851
05:12:19,878 --> 05:12:21,600
there earlier but the the picture seems

6852
05:12:21,600 --> 05:12:22,878
to have improved so I don't know what

6853
05:12:22,878 --> 05:12:25,200
happened on the break but but you're

6854
05:12:25,200 --> 05:12:27,878
you're up you're up and clear go ahead I

6855
05:12:27,878 --> 05:12:29,200
hope I hope you're just speaking about

6856
05:12:29,200 --> 05:12:31,878
my appearance not my arguments Justice

6857
05:12:31,878 --> 05:12:35,600
appearance only yes not the argument go

6858
05:12:35,600 --> 05:12:39,920
ahead please um so so let me take on

6859
05:12:39,920 --> 05:12:42,520
what I think is uh the essence of the

6860
05:12:42,520 --> 05:12:45,680
jurisdiction question here and and this

6861
05:12:45,680 --> 05:12:49,440
has to do with um the statutory process

6862
05:12:49,440 --> 05:12:51,958
under the Customs act and and that

6863
05:12:51,958 --> 05:12:54,638
statutory process in our submission is

6864
05:12:54,638 --> 05:12:57,718
quite Limited in the issues and in the

6865
05:12:57,718 --> 05:13:00,480
remedies um uh that can be considered by

6866
05:13:00,480 --> 05:13:04,400
the CIT and I think Mr NSB in made this

6867
05:13:04,400 --> 05:13:06,680
very clear this morning when he cited to

6868
05:13:06,680 --> 05:13:09,798
section 60 of the Customs Act which

6869
05:13:09,798 --> 05:13:12,760
limits that statutory process to

6870
05:13:12,760 --> 05:13:14,160
questions of

6871
05:13:14,160 --> 05:13:16,320
origin tariff

6872
05:13:16,320 --> 05:13:19,200
classification value for Duty or

6873
05:13:19,200 --> 05:13:21,638
marking nothing in the Customs act

6874
05:13:21,638 --> 05:13:24,760
grants the CIT a broader jurisdiction to

6875
05:13:24,760 --> 05:13:27,400
consider other factors and the factors

6876
05:13:27,400 --> 05:13:29,558
that are in issue in this case this is

6877
05:13:29,558 --> 05:13:32,440
not a case about tariff classification

6878
05:13:32,440 --> 05:13:36,638
value for Duty or Market the CIT cannot

6879
05:13:36,638 --> 05:13:39,360
consider the essence of the wrong that

6880
05:13:39,360 --> 05:13:42,080
Ronco alleges in this case which you

6881
05:13:42,080 --> 05:13:44,480
know there's a whole course of conduct

6882
05:13:44,480 --> 05:13:47,080
that we base our allegations on but I

6883
05:13:47,080 --> 05:13:50,718
think at the heart of it as Mr uh Baxter

6884
05:13:50,718 --> 05:13:53,360
explained in his Ron scarelli argument

6885
05:13:53,360 --> 05:13:55,400
um

6886
05:13:55,400 --> 05:13:58,878
hypothetical this is a case about cbsa

6887
05:13:58,878 --> 05:14:02,040
unequal treatment of Ronco as compared

6888
05:14:02,040 --> 05:14:05,240
to simil similarly situated importers

6889
05:14:05,240 --> 05:14:07,798
without any

6890
05:14:07,798 --> 05:14:10,638
justification and is no suggestion

6891
05:14:10,638 --> 05:14:13,000
before you today Justice gleon that the

6892
05:14:13,000 --> 05:14:16,360
CIT can reckon with that issue that that

6893
05:14:16,360 --> 05:14:19,600
question can go before the CIT and I I

6894
05:14:19,600 --> 05:14:22,120
know that Mr NOS bachin tried to point

6895
05:14:22,120 --> 05:14:25,360
to the fritz case for example to suggest

6896
05:14:25,360 --> 05:14:28,320
that the cit's jurisdiction is is

6897
05:14:28,320 --> 05:14:31,760
broader than questions of origin tariff

6898
05:14:31,760 --> 05:14:33,798
classification or value for Duty or

6899
05:14:33,798 --> 05:14:36,920
marking but as I've seen in the cases

6900
05:14:36,920 --> 05:14:38,760
the the only other thing that can come

6901
05:14:38,760 --> 05:14:41,240
with within uh the cit's jurisdiction as

6902
05:14:41,240 --> 05:14:43,798
these cases suggest is the question of

6903
05:14:43,798 --> 05:14:45,840
whether the original decision was valid

6904
05:14:45,840 --> 05:14:48,360
to begin with right and that's not

6905
05:14:48,360 --> 05:14:50,040
something we're challenging here this

6906
05:14:50,040 --> 05:14:53,558
question of validity now Fritz the fritz

6907
05:14:53,558 --> 05:14:57,200
case was specifically um this is this is

6908
05:14:57,200 --> 05:14:59,680
where the court found that there was no

6909
05:14:59,680 --> 05:15:02,200
jurisdiction to set aside detailed

6910
05:15:02,200 --> 05:15:04,040
adjustment statements which is the very

6911
05:15:04,040 --> 05:15:06,120
reason that we've taken Section 1 a out

6912
05:15:06,120 --> 05:15:07,638
of our

6913
05:15:07,638 --> 05:15:09,920
pleading but when the court looked at

6914
05:15:09,920 --> 05:15:12,760
the case in in Fritz and I think it's

6915
05:15:12,760 --> 05:15:16,120
instructive um uh to turn to and this is

6916
05:15:16,120 --> 05:15:20,320
that the fritz case is at I believe tab

6917
05:15:20,320 --> 05:15:25,638
20 of uh the defendants

6918
05:15:27,558 --> 05:15:30,920
um book of authorities and specifically

6919
05:15:30,920 --> 05:15:34,000
at paragraph

6920
05:15:37,760 --> 05:15:41,400
36 yeah I'm

6921
05:15:42,200 --> 05:15:45,760
there here the the court was saying this

6922
05:15:45,760 --> 05:15:47,558
matter can go to the

6923
05:15:47,558 --> 05:15:50,878
CIT because the CIT does have

6924
05:15:50,878 --> 05:15:53,520
jurisdiction to exclude evidence on

6925
05:15:53,520 --> 05:15:55,520
Charter grounds because remember that

6926
05:15:55,520 --> 05:15:57,440
that's that was the issue in Fritz was

6927
05:15:57,440 --> 05:15:58,920
whether certain evidence had been

6928
05:15:58,920 --> 05:16:01,840
gathered should be excluded or not and

6929
05:16:01,840 --> 05:16:05,718
importantly in in the second sentence no

6930
05:16:05,718 --> 05:16:08,440
one no one appearing that Day suggested

6931
05:16:08,440 --> 05:16:11,520
that the C JT lacks jur jurisdiction to

6932
05:16:11,520 --> 05:16:14,360
exclude evidence on Charter grounds so

6933
05:16:14,360 --> 05:16:16,280
of course with that being the core issue

6934
05:16:16,280 --> 05:16:19,360
the federal court has no problem sending

6935
05:16:19,360 --> 05:16:22,160
um the litigant back to the CIT to deal

6936
05:16:22,160 --> 05:16:23,638
with that issue because no one was

6937
05:16:23,638 --> 05:16:25,760
contesting whether the CIT had

6938
05:16:25,760 --> 05:16:27,638
jurisdiction to deal with that issue or

6939
05:16:27,638 --> 05:16:31,480
not but here Ron's concern is that the

6940
05:16:31,480 --> 05:16:34,240
CIT does not have well it certainly

6941
05:16:34,240 --> 05:16:35,958
doesn't have jurisdiction to adjudicate

6942
05:16:35,958 --> 05:16:38,240
our damages claims doesn't have

6943
05:16:38,240 --> 05:16:40,280
jurisdiction to adjudicate a negligence

6944
05:16:40,280 --> 05:16:42,160
claim doesn't have jurisdiction to

6945
05:16:42,160 --> 05:16:45,200
adjudicate a claim under parody honey

6946
05:16:45,200 --> 05:16:47,798
and it doesn't it is not able to deal

6947
05:16:47,798 --> 05:16:50,600
with the key issue the wrong that we say

6948
05:16:50,600 --> 05:16:53,480
was done here which is treating Ronco

6949
05:16:53,480 --> 05:16:55,840
differently than the other similarly

6950
05:16:55,840 --> 05:16:58,360
situated

6951
05:17:01,280 --> 05:17:04,160
importers and I think it's instructive

6952
05:17:04,160 --> 05:17:08,080
to look at the CIT decision on tariff

6953
05:17:08,080 --> 05:17:10,160
classification that was issued in this

6954
05:17:10,160 --> 05:17:11,680
very

6955
05:17:11,680 --> 05:17:15,718
case and that's in the um defendants

6956
05:17:15,718 --> 05:17:19,320
motion record at exhibit

6957
05:17:21,558 --> 05:17:25,680
D I'm at page 75 of the defendants

6958
05:17:25,680 --> 05:17:29,520
motion record and it's paragraph 63 of

6959
05:17:29,520 --> 05:17:32,600
the CIT

6960
05:17:35,958 --> 05:17:39,680
decision yes I there

6961
05:17:39,680 --> 05:17:43,040
and I'm at the last sentence the CIT

6962
05:17:43,040 --> 05:17:45,080
made very clear to

6963
05:17:45,080 --> 05:17:47,760
Ronco that its mandate and its

6964
05:17:47,760 --> 05:17:49,920
jurisdiction on this kind of appeal is

6965
05:17:49,920 --> 05:17:53,120
quite limited it's simply to determine

6966
05:17:53,120 --> 05:17:55,080
tariff classification of the goods at

6967
05:17:55,080 --> 05:17:58,558
issue it has no power to determine how

6968
05:17:58,558 --> 05:18:00,360
the Tariff classification should

6969
05:18:00,360 --> 05:18:02,920
ultimately impact the appellant with

6970
05:18:02,920 --> 05:18:05,718
respect to the duties imposed nor how

6971
05:18:05,718 --> 05:18:07,920
the Reliance of Ronco upon an advanced

6972
05:18:07,920 --> 05:18:10,120
ruling should INF inuence the cbsa

6973
05:18:10,120 --> 05:18:11,920
decisions on these

6974
05:18:11,920 --> 05:18:15,040
matters so there's a comment there about

6975
05:18:15,040 --> 05:18:18,120
the um limited jurisdiction in terms of

6976
05:18:18,120 --> 05:18:23,920
relief the CIT can't decide how um how

6977
05:18:23,920 --> 05:18:26,558
the Tariff classification or you know in

6978
05:18:26,558 --> 05:18:28,040
our case now it' be the question of

6979
05:18:28,040 --> 05:18:30,718
being treated differently how that

6980
05:18:30,718 --> 05:18:32,440
affects the duties that were imposed

6981
05:18:32,440 --> 05:18:35,680
citd saying we we can't decide that we

6982
05:18:35,680 --> 05:18:37,200
can't give you the relief you're looking

6983
05:18:37,200 --> 05:18:39,558
for and then the second part of the

6984
05:18:39,558 --> 05:18:42,520
sentence is a limit on jurisdiction uh

6985
05:18:42,520 --> 05:18:45,440
as far as subject matter goes saying

6986
05:18:45,440 --> 05:18:48,600
that the CIT can't consider how the

6987
05:18:48,600 --> 05:18:50,520
Reliance of ronow upon an advanced

6988
05:18:50,520 --> 05:18:52,958
ruling should influence the csa's

6989
05:18:52,958 --> 05:18:55,440
decisions on these matters these are

6990
05:18:55,440 --> 05:18:57,600
issues that need to be brought up in a

6991
05:18:57,600 --> 05:19:00,080
federal court action they're issues that

6992
05:19:00,080 --> 05:19:03,080
need to be brought in the context of

6993
05:19:03,080 --> 05:19:05,520
Ron's negligence claim and its parody

6994
05:19:05,520 --> 05:19:07,840
honey claim because those causes of

6995
05:19:07,840 --> 05:19:11,320
action are actually broad enough to um

6996
05:19:11,320 --> 05:19:14,958
evaluate these issues our Reliance on on

6997
05:19:14,958 --> 05:19:17,080
on the fact of Industry practice as

6998
05:19:17,080 --> 05:19:19,840
reflected in that Sumitomo decision and

6999
05:19:19,840 --> 05:19:21,878
the unequal treatment of Ronco as

7000
05:19:21,878 --> 05:19:24,440
compared to the other um similarly

7001
05:19:24,440 --> 05:19:27,000
situated

7002
05:19:27,000 --> 05:19:30,120
importance and quite quite frankly you

7003
05:19:30,120 --> 05:19:33,000
know we've spoken Mr Baxter has spoken

7004
05:19:33,000 --> 05:19:35,558
quite a bit about uh how we see this

7005
05:19:35,558 --> 05:19:38,360
motion as an attempt by the defendants

7006
05:19:38,360 --> 05:19:40,360
to stop this casee from seeing the light

7007
05:19:40,360 --> 05:19:43,400
of day I I think that's why they want to

7008
05:19:43,400 --> 05:19:44,520
be in the

7009
05:19:44,520 --> 05:19:47,600
CIT right it's somewhere where the full

7010
05:19:47,600 --> 05:19:49,958
breadth of this case cannot be

7011
05:19:49,958 --> 05:19:52,280
considered not only will we not get

7012
05:19:52,280 --> 05:19:54,718
Discovery but in fact the full merits of

7013
05:19:54,718 --> 05:19:57,360
the case whether there's evidence or not

7014
05:19:57,360 --> 05:20:00,440
is not going to be decided and I think

7015
05:20:00,440 --> 05:20:03,240
the two jockey candidate cases are quite

7016
05:20:03,240 --> 05:20:06,480
illustrative of this kind of um uh

7017
05:20:06,480 --> 05:20:09,760
procedural strategy uh having been taken

7018
05:20:09,760 --> 05:20:12,600
by um uh the attorney general in the

7019
05:20:12,600 --> 05:20:15,920
context of the Customs act and I turn

7020
05:20:15,920 --> 05:20:18,360
first to the federal court decision

7021
05:20:18,360 --> 05:20:22,280
which is at tab 30 of the um uh

7022
05:20:22,280 --> 05:20:25,280
defendant's motion

7023
05:20:35,060 --> 05:20:36,798
[Music]

7024
05:20:36,798 --> 05:20:39,440
record yes and I think I think Mr nosb

7025
05:20:39,440 --> 05:20:41,320
backin took us here this morning at

7026
05:20:41,320 --> 05:20:46,440
paragraphs 29 and 30 right um the court

7027
05:20:46,440 --> 05:20:47,878
the court is looking at the case and of

7028
05:20:47,878 --> 05:20:49,440
course the the applicants here were

7029
05:20:49,440 --> 05:20:51,638
making an argument that they didn't have

7030
05:20:51,638 --> 05:20:54,360
uh reason to believe uh at the time of

7031
05:20:54,360 --> 05:20:57,958
import and the court says the issue here

7032
05:20:57,958 --> 05:21:00,040
is that this question of reason and

7033
05:21:00,040 --> 05:21:03,400
belief and in section 30 following or in

7034
05:21:03,400 --> 05:21:05,120
paragraph 30 following the fritz

7035
05:21:05,120 --> 05:21:07,480
marketing case the court says I'm of the

7036
05:21:07,480 --> 05:21:08,958
view that this is a matter for the

7037
05:21:08,958 --> 05:21:11,120
president of the C cbsa and if

7038
05:21:11,120 --> 05:21:13,360
unresolved for appeal to the CIT now

7039
05:21:13,360 --> 05:21:15,600
what's interesting is this finding is

7040
05:21:15,600 --> 05:21:17,400
contrary to the representations that

7041
05:21:17,400 --> 05:21:19,638
were made to Ronco which I'll show you

7042
05:21:19,638 --> 05:21:20,400
in a

7043
05:21:20,400 --> 05:21:23,400
minute um but that's the result here

7044
05:21:23,400 --> 05:21:25,680
right this this issue this is what

7045
05:21:25,680 --> 05:21:27,600
happens the federal court says we we

7046
05:21:27,600 --> 05:21:29,080
can't deal with reason to believe

7047
05:21:29,080 --> 05:21:30,958
because it comes within the context it

7048
05:21:30,958 --> 05:21:33,000
comes within the scope of the statutory

7049
05:21:33,000 --> 05:21:36,080
process and sends it to the CIT on the

7050
05:21:36,080 --> 05:21:40,680
arguments of the um uh uh cbsa in this

7051
05:21:40,680 --> 05:21:43,638
case and then at paragraph

7052
05:21:43,638 --> 05:21:47,320
31 sorry not paragraph 31 this is tab 31

7053
05:21:47,320 --> 05:21:49,160
the CIT

7054
05:21:49,160 --> 05:21:51,680
decision

7055
05:21:51,680 --> 05:21:55,040
and the CIT decision in Jockey

7056
05:21:55,040 --> 05:21:58,958
Canada um and I will take you to

7057
05:21:58,958 --> 05:22:02,520
paragraph 260

7058
05:22:09,878 --> 05:22:12,920
and the CIT here granted the CIT is

7059
05:22:12,920 --> 05:22:14,680
talking about reason to believe in the

7060
05:22:14,680 --> 05:22:17,798
context of section 135 of the ACT but

7061
05:22:17,798 --> 05:22:19,638
then that last sentence is instructive

7062
05:22:19,638 --> 05:22:22,480
in these circumstances the cbsa argued

7063
05:22:22,480 --> 05:22:24,280
that it would be for the federal court

7064
05:22:24,280 --> 05:22:26,320
not the tribunal to decide when the

7065
05:22:26,320 --> 05:22:28,240
Importer had reason to believe that its

7066
05:22:28,240 --> 05:22:29,840
declarations were

7067
05:22:29,840 --> 05:22:32,360
incorrect so before the federal court

7068
05:22:32,360 --> 05:22:35,040
the federal court finds reason to

7069
05:22:35,040 --> 05:22:36,798
believe is outside of our

7070
05:22:36,798 --> 05:22:39,080
jurisdiction then the same argument is

7071
05:22:39,080 --> 05:22:41,638
made to the CIT reason to believe is

7072
05:22:41,638 --> 05:22:44,080
outside of your jurisdiction and I take

7073
05:22:44,080 --> 05:22:47,520
Mr NOS Bin's point from this morning and

7074
05:22:47,520 --> 05:22:49,360
this was this was a confusion that I

7075
05:22:49,360 --> 05:22:51,600
think Justice gleon you you asked about

7076
05:22:51,600 --> 05:22:53,360
this morning your questions and it's

7077
05:22:53,360 --> 05:22:54,798
something that took me quite some time

7078
05:22:54,798 --> 05:22:57,080
to understand about this case but reason

7079
05:22:57,080 --> 05:22:59,638
to believe is relevant both in the

7080
05:22:59,638 --> 05:23:02,320
context of the section 60 to 67

7081
05:23:02,320 --> 05:23:05,280
proceedings and it's also relevant in

7082
05:23:05,280 --> 05:23:08,040
the statutory framework for section 129

7083
05:23:08,040 --> 05:23:10,480
and section 135 which is where we come

7084
05:23:10,480 --> 05:23:11,600
before you

7085
05:23:11,600 --> 05:23:14,240
today and I acknowledge that distinction

7086
05:23:14,240 --> 05:23:16,360
and I acknowledge that that's Mr nosb

7087
05:23:16,360 --> 05:23:20,120
and's explanation for why uh uh cbsa got

7088
05:23:20,120 --> 05:23:21,520
in front of the federal court and said

7089
05:23:21,520 --> 05:23:23,558
no jurisdiction to decide reason to

7090
05:23:23,558 --> 05:23:26,240
believe and then got in front of the CIT

7091
05:23:26,240 --> 05:23:28,638
and said no jurisdiction to decide

7092
05:23:28,638 --> 05:23:29,920
reason to

7093
05:23:29,920 --> 05:23:33,120
believe but the effect of that in this

7094
05:23:33,120 --> 05:23:37,040
case right in par or in Jockey Canada as

7095
05:23:37,040 --> 05:23:40,120
it comes before the CIT

7096
05:23:40,120 --> 05:23:42,600
is that reason to believe is not dealt

7097
05:23:42,600 --> 05:23:47,160
with on its merits the CIT in this case

7098
05:23:47,160 --> 05:23:49,718
doesn't make a decision about whether

7099
05:23:49,718 --> 05:23:52,480
jockey Canada had reason to believe or

7100
05:23:52,480 --> 05:23:55,480
not and and Mr Nas backin likes that

7101
05:23:55,480 --> 05:23:58,000
aspect of the case because he relies on

7102
05:23:58,000 --> 05:24:00,440
C the CIT decision to say well reason to

7103
05:24:00,440 --> 05:24:01,878
believe

7104
05:24:01,878 --> 05:24:05,600
isn't isn't relevant to how much uh uh

7105
05:24:05,600 --> 05:24:07,878
to to the duties that should be paid

7106
05:24:07,878 --> 05:24:10,920
right and how that should be

7107
05:24:11,120 --> 05:24:14,480
reassessed but the point is the CIT

7108
05:24:14,480 --> 05:24:16,920
decision maker after receiving

7109
05:24:16,920 --> 05:24:19,760
submissions uh by the cbsa that reason

7110
05:24:19,760 --> 05:24:21,760
to believe is not within its

7111
05:24:21,760 --> 05:24:24,680
jurisdiction avoids making a decision on

7112
05:24:24,680 --> 05:24:28,080
reason to believe and I think this comes

7113
05:24:28,080 --> 05:24:30,040
back to the question of the multiplicity

7114
05:24:30,040 --> 05:24:32,360
of proceedings and something again

7115
05:24:32,360 --> 05:24:34,160
Justice GL that you asked about this

7116
05:24:34,160 --> 05:24:37,440
morning which is the uh danger of

7117
05:24:37,440 --> 05:24:40,240
inconsistent decisions on reason to

7118
05:24:40,240 --> 05:24:43,558
believe the flip side the flip side of

7119
05:24:43,558 --> 05:24:46,080
that danger of too many decisions about

7120
05:24:46,080 --> 05:24:49,440
reason to believe is not enough no

7121
05:24:49,440 --> 05:24:52,360
decisions made about reason to believe

7122
05:24:52,360 --> 05:24:55,520
just just let me jump in there and just

7123
05:24:55,520 --> 05:24:57,718
just make sure I

7124
05:24:57,718 --> 05:25:01,240
clearly understand uh your submissions

7125
05:25:01,240 --> 05:25:04,480
and allow you to understand at least

7126
05:25:04,480 --> 05:25:07,480
what I understand the situation to be

7127
05:25:07,480 --> 05:25:10,320
and

7128
05:25:11,480 --> 05:25:14,240
if a party

7129
05:25:14,240 --> 05:25:17,480
brings an action under Section

7130
05:25:17,480 --> 05:25:21,400
135 in this type of scenario the very

7131
05:25:21,400 --> 05:25:24,320
issue before the court would be the

7132
05:25:24,320 --> 05:25:27,360
reason to believe finding it's it's it's

7133
05:25:27,360 --> 05:25:29,160
whether there's been a contravention and

7134
05:25:29,160 --> 05:25:31,600
as I understand the facts here the

7135
05:25:31,600 --> 05:25:34,160
contravention is based solely and

7136
05:25:34,160 --> 05:25:36,638
strictly upon the reason to believe

7137
05:25:36,638 --> 05:25:39,400
finding and the failure to them file the

7138
05:25:39,400 --> 05:25:42,240
the voluntary adjustments or the the

7139
05:25:42,240 --> 05:25:44,160
self- declared

7140
05:25:44,160 --> 05:25:47,480
adjustments in if I'm correct in that

7141
05:25:47,480 --> 05:25:50,080
understanding there seems to be no doubt

7142
05:25:50,080 --> 05:25:52,760
that the reason to believe issue uh can

7143
05:25:52,760 --> 05:25:56,558
be put before an external decision

7144
05:25:56,558 --> 05:25:59,280
maker so so again I'm getting lost by

7145
05:25:59,280 --> 05:26:01,000
this notion of how somehow this this

7146
05:26:01,000 --> 05:26:04,280
matter can be somehow lost in the

7147
05:26:04,280 --> 05:26:06,320
multitude of potential proceedings

7148
05:26:06,320 --> 05:26:08,718
there's there's a Express clear

7149
05:26:08,718 --> 05:26:10,798
proceeding prescribed by Parliament that

7150
05:26:10,798 --> 05:26:13,160
puts this very issue in this case before

7151
05:26:13,160 --> 05:26:14,240
the federal

7152
05:26:14,240 --> 05:26:17,240
court where there may well be some

7153
05:26:17,240 --> 05:26:19,840
ambiguity is with respect to what the

7154
05:26:19,840 --> 05:26:22,360
citd does with with this reason to

7155
05:26:22,360 --> 05:26:24,558
believe scenario but again as I

7156
05:26:24,558 --> 05:26:26,200
understand the facts in this particular

7157
05:26:26,200 --> 05:26:28,080
case at least from your friend's

7158
05:26:28,080 --> 05:26:30,080
perspective it's unclear to me whether

7159
05:26:30,080 --> 05:26:32,440
you agree with that with with those that

7160
05:26:32,440 --> 05:26:34,638
position or not but reason to believe is

7161
05:26:34,638 --> 05:26:37,240
of no consequence V the

7162
05:26:37,240 --> 05:26:40,280
CIT aspect of this on the unique facts

7163
05:26:40,280 --> 05:26:43,120
of this case so so again so this

7164
05:26:43,120 --> 05:26:44,520
argument that somehow the reason to

7165
05:26:44,520 --> 05:26:48,600
believe issue is runs across all

7166
05:26:48,600 --> 05:26:51,718
proceedings and somehow gets lost just

7167
05:26:51,718 --> 05:26:53,400
doesn't seem to be consistent with my

7168
05:26:53,400 --> 05:26:57,320
understanding of of the process again

7169
05:26:57,320 --> 05:26:59,958
which may be multiple it may be siloed

7170
05:26:59,958 --> 05:27:02,718
um but it doesn't seem to allow this

7171
05:27:02,718 --> 05:27:04,360
issue to get

7172
05:27:04,360 --> 05:27:07,000
lost as I understand you to be

7173
05:27:07,000 --> 05:27:09,360
arguing that and that is my argument

7174
05:27:09,360 --> 05:27:12,120
that it will get lost because if it gets

7175
05:27:12,120 --> 05:27:15,080
decided solely in the context of a

7176
05:27:15,080 --> 05:27:18,000
section 135 action without the

7177
05:27:18,000 --> 05:27:20,520
negligence claim without the parody

7178
05:27:20,520 --> 05:27:23,320
honey claim without the ability to seek

7179
05:27:23,320 --> 05:27:25,520
damages as they are Quantified in our

7180
05:27:25,520 --> 05:27:27,798
statement of claim then reason to

7181
05:27:27,798 --> 05:27:30,440
believe is being decided in a silo where

7182
05:27:30,440 --> 05:27:34,160
the only thing on the line is a

7183
05:27:34,558 --> 05:27:37,480
$1,000 and I think Mr nosp backen said

7184
05:27:37,480 --> 05:27:39,840
this morning we could raise reason to

7185
05:27:39,840 --> 05:27:43,320
believe in the uh proceedings in the

7186
05:27:43,320 --> 05:27:46,840
CIT he just says that um uh that they

7187
05:27:46,840 --> 05:27:49,320
wouldn't have any effect and we disagree

7188
05:27:49,320 --> 05:27:51,600
with that we vehemently disagree with

7189
05:27:51,600 --> 05:27:53,680
that and I'll show you in a moment why

7190
05:27:53,680 --> 05:27:56,840
those that position taken by Mr nosb in

7191
05:27:56,840 --> 05:27:59,320
today is inconsistent with the position

7192
05:27:59,320 --> 05:28:01,360
that the cbsa has taken in the past and

7193
05:28:01,360 --> 05:28:03,878
I think that's significant as well but

7194
05:28:03,878 --> 05:28:06,840
but the point is reason to believe would

7195
05:28:06,840 --> 05:28:09,240
be decided in a small small Silo only

7196
05:28:09,240 --> 05:28:10,558
dealing with the question of the

7197
05:28:10,558 --> 05:28:11,798
Thousand

7198
05:28:11,798 --> 05:28:14,920
penalty I'm not sure if the CIT would

7199
05:28:14,920 --> 05:28:16,958
decide reason to believe I'm not sure if

7200
05:28:16,958 --> 05:28:18,760
they would make a factual finding about

7201
05:28:18,760 --> 05:28:21,638
reason to believe because the CIT didn't

7202
05:28:21,638 --> 05:28:24,798
injy Canada they specifically avoided it

7203
05:28:24,798 --> 05:28:26,520
because they were told that reason to

7204
05:28:26,520 --> 05:28:29,200
believe is properly dealt with only in a

7205
05:28:29,200 --> 05:28:31,440
section 135 action before the federal

7206
05:28:31,440 --> 05:28:33,638
court so we would be arguing if we went

7207
05:28:33,638 --> 05:28:36,120
back to the CIT like Mr nosb and is

7208
05:28:36,120 --> 05:28:39,520
asking us we' be there and that's that's

7209
05:28:39,520 --> 05:28:42,400
where he says that the True priz Lies if

7210
05:28:42,400 --> 05:28:45,000
you want to have the Das overturned

7211
05:28:45,000 --> 05:28:47,958
you've got to go to the CIT and he says

7212
05:28:47,958 --> 05:28:50,480
well you you can have reason to believe

7213
05:28:50,480 --> 05:28:53,080
uh uh dealt with there but the CIT is

7214
05:28:53,080 --> 05:28:54,480
just going to tell you it doesn't mean

7215
05:28:54,480 --> 05:28:56,000
anything for your

7216
05:28:56,000 --> 05:28:58,798
case I'm not sure that the CIT would

7217
05:28:58,798 --> 05:29:01,200
even I I don't know that the CIT would

7218
05:29:01,200 --> 05:29:03,760
address reason to believe on its

7219
05:29:03,760 --> 05:29:06,360
merits just in the same way that it

7220
05:29:06,360 --> 05:29:08,840
wasn't addressed on its merits in Jockey

7221
05:29:08,840 --> 05:29:11,120
Canada and and then the other point I

7222
05:29:11,120 --> 05:29:13,160
need to make about reason to believe is

7223
05:29:13,160 --> 05:29:16,440
as Central as that is to Ron's claim

7224
05:29:16,440 --> 05:29:18,080
it's a very important piece of the

7225
05:29:18,080 --> 05:29:20,040
puzzle in our negligence claim and our

7226
05:29:20,040 --> 05:29:22,520
parody honey claim but it is only one

7227
05:29:22,520 --> 05:29:23,558
piece of the

7228
05:29:23,558 --> 05:29:26,200
puzzle the broader context is the

7229
05:29:26,200 --> 05:29:28,280
allegation that Ronco was treated

7230
05:29:28,280 --> 05:29:30,798
differently than other situate similarly

7231
05:29:30,798 --> 05:29:33,520
situated importers and those those two

7232
05:29:33,520 --> 05:29:35,798
things feed on each other because of

7233
05:29:35,798 --> 05:29:38,360
course part of our lack of reason to

7234
05:29:38,360 --> 05:29:40,878
believe at the time of import was

7235
05:29:40,878 --> 05:29:43,320
because everyone else was allowed to

7236
05:29:43,320 --> 05:29:46,000
import the goods uh at issue under

7237
05:29:46,000 --> 05:29:49,400
tariff 21 so those things feed on each

7238
05:29:49,400 --> 05:29:52,480
other but even if even if reason to

7239
05:29:52,480 --> 05:29:57,200
believe uh uh can be dealt with in the

7240
05:29:57,200 --> 05:30:00,240
CIT there's no jurisdiction to deal with

7241
05:30:00,240 --> 05:30:02,520
the true question of the wrong which is

7242
05:30:02,520 --> 05:30:04,558
Ronco being treated differently than

7243
05:30:04,558 --> 05:30:06,840
others and I think the point of the

7244
05:30:06,840 --> 05:30:09,840
Jockey Canada case and the point of uh

7245
05:30:09,840 --> 05:30:12,040
the multiplicity of proceedings is also

7246
05:30:12,040 --> 05:30:14,600
that not only do you risk multiple

7247
05:30:14,600 --> 05:30:18,000
decision makers making uh uh decisions

7248
05:30:18,000 --> 05:30:20,840
about the same issue but you also risk a

7249
05:30:20,840 --> 05:30:23,120
hesitancy on the part of a decision

7250
05:30:23,120 --> 05:30:26,320
maker to make a decision on the issue

7251
05:30:26,320 --> 05:30:29,520
just like the CIT and jockey Canada uh

7252
05:30:29,520 --> 05:30:32,600
because there's there's an awareness

7253
05:30:32,600 --> 05:30:34,160
that in fact it is something that's

7254
05:30:34,160 --> 05:30:36,160
going to be treated in multiple

7255
05:30:36,160 --> 05:30:40,320
proceedings um I I I I hope that I hope

7256
05:30:40,320 --> 05:30:43,160
that I've made myself clear on on those

7257
05:30:43,160 --> 05:30:46,558
points I I would like to move on to deal

7258
05:30:46,558 --> 05:30:51,718
with um our argument that uh cbsa is a

7259
05:30:51,718 --> 05:30:53,760
stopped from making its jurisdiction

7260
05:30:53,760 --> 05:30:56,760
argument today and just to show you some

7261
05:30:56,760 --> 05:30:59,360
of the representations that Ronco relied

7262
05:30:59,360 --> 05:31:02,200
on in the course of this appeals

7263
05:31:02,200 --> 05:31:04,920
process and and just

7264
05:31:04,920 --> 05:31:08,040
to before you move on I just wanted to

7265
05:31:08,040 --> 05:31:10,320
be clear that you're going to address my

7266
05:31:10,320 --> 05:31:12,040
question my very specific question

7267
05:31:12,040 --> 05:31:16,000
around uh paragraph 1D and how that how

7268
05:31:16,000 --> 05:31:17,958
that claim for damages fits within the

7269
05:31:17,958 --> 05:31:20,120
context of the CIT process in light of

7270
05:31:20,120 --> 05:31:23,480
your position on paragraph 1A so um so

7271
05:31:23,480 --> 05:31:25,120
if you're doing that later fine but if

7272
05:31:25,120 --> 05:31:26,718
you're not I'd like to hear that before

7273
05:31:26,718 --> 05:31:29,200
you go to the the stop discussion no I I

7274
05:31:29,200 --> 05:31:31,280
think I I think I would deal with that

7275
05:31:31,280 --> 05:31:34,520
now I I had understood I had understood

7276
05:31:34,520 --> 05:31:37,000
that um uh that question to be in the

7277
05:31:37,000 --> 05:31:39,240
context of the St

7278
05:31:39,240 --> 05:31:43,080
process um uh taking over that kind of

7279
05:31:43,080 --> 05:31:46,600
relief was I I think what I heard um

7280
05:31:46,600 --> 05:31:49,600
heard you saying and and the point I was

7281
05:31:49,600 --> 05:31:51,280
I was making was that in fact that

7282
05:31:51,280 --> 05:31:54,760
statutory process is not wide enough to

7283
05:31:54,760 --> 05:31:58,000
consider the merits of Ron's claim right

7284
05:31:58,000 --> 05:32:00,558
and that's why we should be able to seek

7285
05:32:00,558 --> 05:32:04,480
damages resulting from cbsa conduct in

7286
05:32:04,480 --> 05:32:06,120
this federal court proceeding because

7287
05:32:06,120 --> 05:32:08,480
other otherwise we are not not going to

7288
05:32:08,480 --> 05:32:11,400
have that fundamental question the wrong

7289
05:32:11,400 --> 05:32:13,718
that we say was done to Ronco

7290
05:32:13,718 --> 05:32:16,638
adjudicated will be before the CIT where

7291
05:32:16,638 --> 05:32:19,240
we can't deal with that issue and I I'm

7292
05:32:19,240 --> 05:32:21,240
I'm not even sure that the CIT could

7293
05:32:21,240 --> 05:32:23,958
grant us the duties based on the

7294
05:32:23,958 --> 05:32:26,320
paragraph that I showed uh that I showed

7295
05:32:26,320 --> 05:32:29,080
you a moment ago from the CIT decision

7296
05:32:29,080 --> 05:32:31,320
the last time Ronco was there on tariff

7297
05:32:31,320 --> 05:32:34,638
classification where the CIT told us um

7298
05:32:34,638 --> 05:32:36,520
that they couldn't make a decision about

7299
05:32:36,520 --> 05:32:39,000
how the Importer was uh ultimately

7300
05:32:39,000 --> 05:32:41,718
affected with respect to duties so I

7301
05:32:41,718 --> 05:32:44,360
don't I don't know and I don't think

7302
05:32:44,360 --> 05:32:47,040
that that statutory process is actually

7303
05:32:47,040 --> 05:32:50,600
one where Ronco can get um uh those

7304
05:32:50,600 --> 05:32:53,638
amounts that it seeks and and and that's

7305
05:32:53,638 --> 05:32:55,680
why we've Quantified our damages that

7306
05:32:55,680 --> 05:32:57,360
way because we say that that is the

7307
05:32:57,360 --> 05:33:00,480
result of the conduct of

7308
05:33:02,558 --> 05:33:05,080
cbsa I I think that addresses my

7309
05:33:05,080 --> 05:33:07,000
question I I think I still struggle with

7310
05:33:07,000 --> 05:33:09,558
this notion that that

7311
05:33:09,558 --> 05:33:11,920
somehow within within the structure of

7312
05:33:11,920 --> 05:33:14,920
this argument there seems to be at least

7313
05:33:14,920 --> 05:33:16,638
an implication that somehow the

7314
05:33:16,638 --> 05:33:19,958
statutory process can be avoided and uh

7315
05:33:19,958 --> 05:33:22,680
and I I haven't really heard either you

7316
05:33:22,680 --> 05:33:25,878
or Mr Baxter specifically address that

7317
05:33:25,878 --> 05:33:28,280
to my satisfaction to say Parliament has

7318
05:33:28,280 --> 05:33:31,240
described this process uh your friends

7319
05:33:31,240 --> 05:33:33,240
argue that the amount that you're

7320
05:33:33,240 --> 05:33:37,360
seeking in Damages at at paragraph 1D is

7321
05:33:37,360 --> 05:33:41,558
ESS entially an effort

7322
05:33:41,558 --> 05:33:44,360
to adopt a different approach than that

7323
05:33:44,360 --> 05:33:46,520
prescribed by Parliament to deal with

7324
05:33:46,520 --> 05:33:48,920
the imposition of Duties and uh and

7325
05:33:48,920 --> 05:33:51,958
interest and and as I say perhaps I'm

7326
05:33:51,958 --> 05:33:54,040
I'm just not getting it from the

7327
05:33:54,040 --> 05:33:55,160
perspective the argument you're

7328
05:33:55,160 --> 05:33:57,480
advancing uh I hear the point you're

7329
05:33:57,480 --> 05:33:59,280
making with respect to the broader

7330
05:33:59,280 --> 05:34:02,040
aspect of the claim uh but I'm not quite

7331
05:34:02,040 --> 05:34:04,760
sure how that then allows you to avoid

7332
05:34:04,760 --> 05:34:07,120
the process with respect to the specific

7333
05:34:07,120 --> 05:34:08,400
issue

7334
05:34:08,400 --> 05:34:10,080
of Duties and the

7335
05:34:10,080 --> 05:34:13,400
classification of the uh the proper

7336
05:34:13,400 --> 05:34:18,000
tariff uh by by by using a different

7337
05:34:18,000 --> 05:34:21,120
label with respect to that Duty and and

7338
05:34:21,120 --> 05:34:26,160
and and interest order um in a damages

7339
05:34:26,160 --> 05:34:29,040
claim in an action to say I'm I'm I'm

7340
05:34:29,040 --> 05:34:32,760
not there yet in understanding exactly

7341
05:34:32,760 --> 05:34:34,760
how you're advancing that view and as I

7342
05:34:34,760 --> 05:34:37,878
say my my confusion becomes uh even

7343
05:34:37,878 --> 05:34:40,360
greater given your position on paragraph

7344
05:34:40,360 --> 05:34:43,240
1A uh if you were somehow maintaining

7345
05:34:43,240 --> 05:34:46,360
the view that 1A can advance Then I then

7346
05:34:46,360 --> 05:34:48,000
I would feel there was some consistency

7347
05:34:48,000 --> 05:34:49,320
I'm not quite sure I'm following the

7348
05:34:49,320 --> 05:34:51,520
consistency between your position on 1 a

7349
05:34:51,520 --> 05:34:52,240
and

7350
05:34:52,240 --> 05:34:55,320
1D having said that I understand

7351
05:34:55,320 --> 05:34:57,040
generally the argument you're advancing

7352
05:34:57,040 --> 05:34:58,878
I'm just not sure how it fits together

7353
05:34:58,878 --> 05:35:00,558
with respect to that particular

7354
05:35:00,558 --> 05:35:04,558
paragraph of the amended statement of

7355
05:35:05,718 --> 05:35:09,040
claims I confer with Mr Mr Baxter for

7356
05:35:09,040 --> 05:35:11,120
one second and then and then we'll we'll

7357
05:35:11,120 --> 05:35:15,000
continue certainly absolutely

7358
05:35:47,120 --> 05:35:49,920
I I I I get the sense that you do

7359
05:35:49,920 --> 05:35:51,558
understand our submissions on this and I

7360
05:35:51,558 --> 05:35:53,200
I would refer you back to our written

7361
05:35:53,200 --> 05:35:56,520
submissions as well to to ensure that uh

7362
05:35:56,520 --> 05:35:58,558
that you understand them in detail and I

7363
05:35:58,558 --> 05:36:00,760
I hope they will alleviate uh your

7364
05:36:00,760 --> 05:36:03,558
concerns and I I I guess the last the

7365
05:36:03,558 --> 05:36:06,000
last point I'd make and I I think I

7366
05:36:06,000 --> 05:36:08,240
think you you do

7367
05:36:08,240 --> 05:36:10,558
understand this but if if we were

7368
05:36:10,558 --> 05:36:12,360
advancing an

7369
05:36:12,360 --> 05:36:15,040
action um uh where we were claiming

7370
05:36:15,040 --> 05:36:15,958
these

7371
05:36:15,958 --> 05:36:19,840
damages and it was on the basis of uh

7372
05:36:19,840 --> 05:36:22,280
determinations of origin tariff

7373
05:36:22,280 --> 05:36:24,840
classification value for Duty or marking

7374
05:36:24,840 --> 05:36:27,440
which which are which are the issues in

7375
05:36:27,440 --> 05:36:30,718
that statutory process then then I could

7376
05:36:30,718 --> 05:36:32,600
understand why the statutory process

7377
05:36:32,600 --> 05:36:34,958
usurps the the the Juris or out the

7378
05:36:34,958 --> 05:36:37,600
jurisdiction of the federal court and

7379
05:36:37,600 --> 05:36:39,878
our submission is that because our uh

7380
05:36:39,878 --> 05:36:42,520
because the wrong that we claim because

7381
05:36:42,520 --> 05:36:44,798
our claim is not anchored in those

7382
05:36:44,798 --> 05:36:47,000
issues then we should be able to seek

7383
05:36:47,000 --> 05:36:49,280
those damages and in fact we're not we

7384
05:36:49,280 --> 05:36:51,600
are not circumventing the statutory

7385
05:36:51,600 --> 05:36:54,200
process we're taking the only Avenue

7386
05:36:54,200 --> 05:36:57,040
that is open to us in a way uh in a way

7387
05:36:57,040 --> 05:37:00,080
to recover the damages that we allege I

7388
05:37:00,080 --> 05:37:02,480
I'm not going to belabor the point I I

7389
05:37:02,480 --> 05:37:08,120
think I think it's worth moving on um

7390
05:37:08,320 --> 05:37:10,440
and I want to deal with the uh uh the

7391
05:37:10,440 --> 05:37:14,558
estole issues here um You' you've heard

7392
05:37:14,558 --> 05:37:16,920
a bit about uh Mr Baxter has referred to

7393
05:37:16,920 --> 05:37:18,920
the game of snakes and La ladders that

7394
05:37:18,920 --> 05:37:20,878
Ronco has been through and all of this

7395
05:37:20,878 --> 05:37:23,638
has been in the context of a complex um

7396
05:37:23,638 --> 05:37:25,760
uh appeals proceeding where Ronco has

7397
05:37:25,760 --> 05:37:28,200
been down many different Avenues and had

7398
05:37:28,200 --> 05:37:30,320
many different representations made to

7399
05:37:30,320 --> 05:37:32,760
it about uh the proceedings and the

7400
05:37:32,760 --> 05:37:36,200
appropriate venue uh to proceed in and

7401
05:37:36,200 --> 05:37:38,000
our submission is that those

7402
05:37:38,000 --> 05:37:40,480
those representations made to Ronco have

7403
05:37:40,480 --> 05:37:42,958
been in a state of constant

7404
05:37:42,958 --> 05:37:45,920
Evolution um it there's no debate that

7405
05:37:45,920 --> 05:37:49,000
aole applies in the public law context

7406
05:37:49,000 --> 05:37:51,440
and Mr Mayor referred you to the am Jac

7407
05:37:51,440 --> 05:37:53,840
robit Tai Supreme Court case this

7408
05:37:53,840 --> 05:37:56,280
morning and I think he he put it quite

7409
05:37:56,280 --> 05:37:59,000
well when he said a Public Authority

7410
05:37:59,000 --> 05:38:02,280
cannot deviate from its previous

7411
05:38:02,280 --> 05:38:04,718
representations that is the essence of a

7412
05:38:04,718 --> 05:38:09,000
stole and the specific um uh elements of

7413
05:38:09,000 --> 05:38:11,360
of a of public law EST stopple there has

7414
05:38:11,360 --> 05:38:14,440
to be a clear and unambiguous promise

7415
05:38:14,440 --> 05:38:18,360
made to a citizen by a Public

7416
05:38:19,040 --> 05:38:21,520
Authority it has to be made in order to

7417
05:38:21,520 --> 05:38:23,200
induce a certain

7418
05:38:23,200 --> 05:38:26,120
act and then the citizen must rely on

7419
05:38:26,120 --> 05:38:28,360
that promise and act on it by changing

7420
05:38:28,360 --> 05:38:31,480
their conduct I I would just note

7421
05:38:31,480 --> 05:38:34,280
quickly that the concept of Promise in

7422
05:38:34,280 --> 05:38:36,680
the promisor estole context especially

7423
05:38:36,680 --> 05:38:38,040
on the part of a prise

7424
05:38:38,040 --> 05:38:42,360
a public law Authority is quite wide um

7425
05:38:42,360 --> 05:38:44,440
I and I think it's akin to

7426
05:38:44,440 --> 05:38:46,798
representation so if you read the the

7427
05:38:46,798 --> 05:38:50,240
other case that we have uh uh cited I

7428
05:38:50,240 --> 05:38:52,400
don't think we need to go there but I'll

7429
05:38:52,400 --> 05:38:53,920
I'll just give you the reference and

7430
05:38:53,920 --> 05:38:56,160
this is the Samsung Electronics case at

7431
05:38:56,160 --> 05:38:58,718
tab 13 of our book of authorities there

7432
05:38:58,718 --> 05:39:01,160
was an access to information request

7433
05:39:01,160 --> 05:39:03,240
Health Canada released two

7434
05:39:03,240 --> 05:39:05,958
decisions um they argued that only the

7435
05:39:05,958 --> 05:39:07,958
second decision stood

7436
05:39:07,958 --> 05:39:09,520
and the court found that Health Canada

7437
05:39:09,520 --> 05:39:11,878
was a stop from going back on that first

7438
05:39:11,878 --> 05:39:14,320
decision and there the decision of

7439
05:39:14,320 --> 05:39:15,718
Health Canada on an access to

7440
05:39:15,718 --> 05:39:19,160
information request fit the criteria for

7441
05:39:19,160 --> 05:39:22,120
a a promise so I take that notion of

7442
05:39:22,120 --> 05:39:26,080
promise to be quite wide in terms of

7443
05:39:26,080 --> 05:39:28,240
representations and I want to take you

7444
05:39:28,240 --> 05:39:31,040
through the um the representations that

7445
05:39:31,040 --> 05:39:33,760
were made to Ronco here and the first

7446
05:39:33,760 --> 05:39:36,440
representation made by Miss Ogie and

7447
05:39:36,440 --> 05:39:38,360
this needs to be looked it in the

7448
05:39:38,360 --> 05:39:41,760
context of uh Mr nosac and submissions

7449
05:39:41,760 --> 05:39:45,120
this morning that reason to believe can

7450
05:39:45,120 --> 05:39:47,240
be dealt with in the

7451
05:39:47,240 --> 05:39:50,638
CIT because this runs directly contrary

7452
05:39:50,638 --> 05:39:53,040
to what Ronco was told by an appeals

7453
05:39:53,040 --> 05:39:55,958
officer of the cbsa at the beginning of

7454
05:39:55,958 --> 05:39:59,440
these proceedings and I'd take you to

7455
05:39:59,440 --> 05:40:04,200
Exhibit C of our motion record

7456
05:40:08,000 --> 05:40:11,478
and um just to start at the bottom of

7457
05:40:11,478 --> 05:40:15,520
the email chain which is at page 54 of

7458
05:40:15,520 --> 05:40:18,120
our motion

7459
05:40:27,200 --> 05:40:30,200
record

7460
05:40:30,878 --> 05:40:34,760
yes so Ronco had initiated the statutory

7461
05:40:34,760 --> 05:40:37,718
process under Section 60 to section 6 7

7462
05:40:37,718 --> 05:40:39,798
of the Customs Act made their

7463
05:40:39,798 --> 05:40:42,798
submissions to the cbsa and Ronco had

7464
05:40:42,798 --> 05:40:44,558
made submissions on tariff

7465
05:40:44,558 --> 05:40:46,240
classification and they' made

7466
05:40:46,240 --> 05:40:48,440
submissions or we've made submissions on

7467
05:40:48,440 --> 05:40:51,760
reason to believe and then miss Ogie the

7468
05:40:51,760 --> 05:40:54,400
appeals officer for the cbsa emails

7469
05:40:54,400 --> 05:40:57,958
Ron's representative on her own accord

7470
05:40:57,958 --> 05:41:00,478
responding to our uh our submission

7471
05:41:00,478 --> 05:41:02,798
saying I've been reviewing your appeal

7472
05:41:02,798 --> 05:41:05,400
letter concerning tariff classification

7473
05:41:05,400 --> 05:41:07,920
you also discuss reason to believe

7474
05:41:07,920 --> 05:41:10,840
have you appealed the penalty I will

7475
05:41:10,840 --> 05:41:13,878
only be dealing with tariff

7476
05:41:13,878 --> 05:41:16,400
classification so this is the cbsa

7477
05:41:16,400 --> 05:41:19,280
spontaneously telling us we're not going

7478
05:41:19,280 --> 05:41:22,478
to deal with reason to believe and these

7479
05:41:22,478 --> 05:41:24,718
representations become much clearer

7480
05:41:24,718 --> 05:41:26,558
higher up in the chain that's that's the

7481
05:41:26,558 --> 05:41:27,840
beginning of the unambiguous

7482
05:41:27,840 --> 05:41:32,400
representations but M Mr Clark uh who is

7483
05:41:32,400 --> 05:41:35,320
a representative of Ronco responds and

7484
05:41:35,320 --> 05:41:37,718
this is if you scroll up to page 15 53

7485
05:41:37,718 --> 05:41:42,320
or turn to page 5 turn back to page

7486
05:41:42,760 --> 05:41:46,520
53 Mr Clark clarifies Ron's position

7487
05:41:46,520 --> 05:41:49,680
which is uh reason to believe is

7488
05:41:49,680 --> 05:41:52,440
included as a part of this appeal to

7489
05:41:52,440 --> 05:41:54,760
address the requirement to correct these

7490
05:41:54,760 --> 05:41:57,920
import transactions Ronco has been very

7491
05:41:57,920 --> 05:42:00,040
clear with the cbsa since the beginning

7492
05:42:00,040 --> 05:42:02,878
of this case that we believe that reason

7493
05:42:02,878 --> 05:42:06,160
to believe is tied to the uh the issue

7494
05:42:06,160 --> 05:42:08,120
of whether Ronco should be required to

7495
05:42:08,120 --> 05:42:10,320
pay duties or not that relates to the

7496
05:42:10,320 --> 05:42:12,400
reassessment policy which we will get to

7497
05:42:12,400 --> 05:42:15,840
in a minute and Mr Clark asked Miss Ogie

7498
05:42:15,840 --> 05:42:19,080
to confirm you do not have jurisdiction

7499
05:42:19,080 --> 05:42:22,680
to hear an appeal of reason to

7500
05:42:22,680 --> 05:42:25,760
believe and Miss Clark responds turning

7501
05:42:25,760 --> 05:42:28,400
back to page

7502
05:42:29,360 --> 05:42:33,600
52 yes you are correct I do not have

7503
05:42:33,600 --> 05:42:36,600
jurisdiction under a section 60 appeal

7504
05:42:36,600 --> 05:42:39,040
to deal with reason to

7505
05:42:39,040 --> 05:42:41,958
believe and this runs directly contrary

7506
05:42:41,958 --> 05:42:44,320
to what Mr nosb was saying today the

7507
05:42:44,320 --> 05:42:46,520
suggestion that we could bring reason to

7508
05:42:46,520 --> 05:42:49,558
believe before the CIT Miss oovi does

7509
05:42:49,558 --> 05:42:51,958
not tell us reason to believe doesn't

7510
05:42:51,958 --> 05:42:54,638
matter she doesn't say reason to believe

7511
05:42:54,638 --> 05:42:57,320
is not a basis on which to challenge

7512
05:42:57,320 --> 05:43:00,040
duties that's not what we're told we're

7513
05:43:00,040 --> 05:43:03,478
told there is no jurisdiction within the

7514
05:43:03,478 --> 05:43:06,520
Customs act process under Section 60 to

7515
05:43:06,520 --> 05:43:09,440
deal with reason to believe and I I

7516
05:43:09,440 --> 05:43:12,160
think these are clear these are as clear

7517
05:43:12,160 --> 05:43:14,600
and unambiguous as representations from

7518
05:43:14,600 --> 05:43:17,638
a public La Authority can get they were

7519
05:43:17,638 --> 05:43:20,240
meant to induce Ronco not to pursue

7520
05:43:20,240 --> 05:43:23,360
reason to believe within that section 60

7521
05:43:23,360 --> 05:43:26,958
to section 67 process and Ronco in fact

7522
05:43:26,958 --> 05:43:29,360
relied on those uh uh

7523
05:43:29,360 --> 05:43:31,760
representations and waited to challenge

7524
05:43:31,760 --> 05:43:34,320
reason to believe until it brought the

7525
05:43:34,320 --> 05:43:37,558
section 129 appeal to the minister

7526
05:43:37,558 --> 05:43:40,360
and then uh the section 135 action which

7527
05:43:40,360 --> 05:43:43,200
is which is why this issue of reason to

7528
05:43:43,200 --> 05:43:46,400
believe comes to this court in this um

7529
05:43:46,400 --> 05:43:48,680
uh in this form because we were told

7530
05:43:48,680 --> 05:43:50,718
that's the only place that you can deal

7531
05:43:50,718 --> 05:43:53,520
with reason to

7532
05:43:54,840 --> 05:43:57,440
believe um it's also a very clear and

7533
05:43:57,440 --> 05:43:59,638
unambiguous representation about the

7534
05:43:59,638 --> 05:44:02,520
limitations on the jurisdiction uh under

7535
05:44:02,520 --> 05:44:06,478
Section 60 to 67 and I I I think I think

7536
05:44:06,478 --> 05:44:09,000
J as as you reckon with the question of

7537
05:44:09,000 --> 05:44:12,360
how wide a jurisdiction the CIT has

7538
05:44:12,360 --> 05:44:14,878
under the process outlined in those

7539
05:44:14,878 --> 05:44:16,878
Provisions I think it's important to

7540
05:44:16,878 --> 05:44:18,638
take these representations into

7541
05:44:18,638 --> 05:44:20,240
consideration as well as the

7542
05:44:20,240 --> 05:44:22,558
representations on the CIT decision

7543
05:44:22,558 --> 05:44:24,798
which I I took you to

7544
05:44:24,798 --> 05:44:26,760
earlier there are further

7545
05:44:26,760 --> 05:44:30,080
representations made to Ronco that um

7546
05:44:30,080 --> 05:44:32,680
are in some ways consistent with what

7547
05:44:32,680 --> 05:44:34,878
Miss Ogie said and in some ways

7548
05:44:34,878 --> 05:44:36,680
inconsistent in that they direct us

7549
05:44:36,680 --> 05:44:39,878
towards a judicial review procedure and

7550
05:44:39,878 --> 05:44:45,080
those are at exhibit F of our motion

7551
05:44:46,080 --> 05:44:48,680
record and this

7552
05:44:48,680 --> 05:44:50,920
is uh at page

7553
05:44:50,920 --> 05:44:54,360
82 and it's it's quite a a technical

7554
05:44:54,360 --> 05:44:56,680
Email exchange so rather than read

7555
05:44:56,680 --> 05:44:59,240
through all of it I I will just give you

7556
05:44:59,240 --> 05:45:03,280
the context um uh Ronco at this point

7557
05:45:03,280 --> 05:45:07,558
had made its um appeal under Section 29

7558
05:45:07,558 --> 05:45:10,680
to the minister um and there was a

7559
05:45:10,680 --> 05:45:12,840
discussion between Ronco and Miss Ali

7560
05:45:12,840 --> 05:45:15,958
Muhammad of the cbsa as to whether Ronco

7561
05:45:15,958 --> 05:45:18,400
would be required to pay duties before

7562
05:45:18,400 --> 05:45:21,680
exhausting the appeals mechanism uh Mrs

7563
05:45:21,680 --> 05:45:23,878
Miss Ali Muhammad was aware that Ronco

7564
05:45:23,878 --> 05:45:25,798
had raised reason to believe in its

7565
05:45:25,798 --> 05:45:28,160
appeal to the section 12 uh uh to the

7566
05:45:28,160 --> 05:45:29,798
minister under section

7567
05:45:29,798 --> 05:45:32,680
129 and and the reason that Ronco had

7568
05:45:32,680 --> 05:45:37,478
raised reason to believe um uh what was

7569
05:45:37,478 --> 05:45:40,958
not just as it relates to the Penalty it

7570
05:45:40,958 --> 05:45:42,520
was also as it relates to the

7571
05:45:42,520 --> 05:45:45,200
reassessment policy which we say is the

7572
05:45:45,200 --> 05:45:47,760
reason why Ronco should not have had to

7573
05:45:47,760 --> 05:45:50,240
have paid duties

7574
05:45:50,240 --> 05:45:54,440
and Miss Ali Muhammad says very clearly

7575
05:45:54,440 --> 05:45:57,040
there is no review mechanism provided

7576
05:45:57,040 --> 05:45:59,040
within the Customs act that allows for

7577
05:45:59,040 --> 05:46:01,520
an appeal or review of the application

7578
05:46:01,520 --> 05:46:03,558
of the reassessment

7579
05:46:03,558 --> 05:46:07,280
policy and then directs us uh directs

7580
05:46:07,280 --> 05:46:10,760
Ronco um uh to commence a judicial

7581
05:46:10,760 --> 05:46:13,440
review so initially we're told reason to

7582
05:46:13,440 --> 05:46:15,360
believe needs to be dealt with under

7583
05:46:15,360 --> 05:46:18,400
section 129 and section 135 that's the

7584
05:46:18,400 --> 05:46:20,558
only place but now that you're talking

7585
05:46:20,558 --> 05:46:22,558
about reason to believe in the context

7586
05:46:22,558 --> 05:46:25,680
of a reassessment policy okay now now

7587
05:46:25,680 --> 05:46:26,958
you actually have to go over to this

7588
05:46:26,958 --> 05:46:30,360
door and commence a judicial

7589
05:46:30,440 --> 05:46:33,120
review and that's that's the only reason

7590
05:46:33,120 --> 05:46:34,878
that Ronco commenced that judicial

7591
05:46:34,878 --> 05:46:37,638
review was was to preserve its rights

7592
05:46:37,638 --> 05:46:39,798
we relied on the clear and unambiguous

7593
05:46:39,798 --> 05:46:42,558
representations of Miss Al Muhammad and

7594
05:46:42,558 --> 05:46:45,000
and commen that proceeding to preserve

7595
05:46:45,000 --> 05:46:47,280
our

7596
05:47:02,160 --> 05:47:05,400
rights so that judicial review

7597
05:47:05,400 --> 05:47:08,400
application

7598
05:47:11,760 --> 05:47:13,320
actually seeks judicial review of the

7599
05:47:13,320 --> 05:47:14,878
Das so does it

7600
05:47:14,878 --> 05:47:18,360
not I I believe it does in the context

7601
05:47:18,360 --> 05:47:21,638
of the reassessment policy

7602
05:47:21,638 --> 05:47:23,240
and

7603
05:47:23,240 --> 05:47:25,600
well so what was what's the issue on

7604
05:47:25,600 --> 05:47:27,240
that judicial review

7605
05:47:27,240 --> 05:47:31,200
the the application of the an

7606
05:47:31,200 --> 05:47:33,600
interpretation of the assessment policy

7607
05:47:33,600 --> 05:47:35,840
or the

7608
05:47:35,840 --> 05:47:38,558
Das

7609
05:47:38,558 --> 05:47:41,798
again does my question is does the

7610
05:47:41,798 --> 05:47:43,760
judicial review application actually

7611
05:47:43,760 --> 05:47:45,798
line up with the representation that

7612
05:47:45,798 --> 05:47:48,200
that you just pointed me to well I I

7613
05:47:48,200 --> 05:47:50,600
believe that it is reviewing the dask in

7614
05:47:50,600 --> 05:47:53,958
light of the reassessment

7615
05:47:59,040 --> 05:48:02,179
[Music]

7616
05:48:03,520 --> 05:48:07,240
policy yeah so it it is it is viewing

7617
05:48:07,240 --> 05:48:09,600
the detailed adjustment

7618
05:48:09,600 --> 05:48:12,240
statements on Ron's theory that they

7619
05:48:12,240 --> 05:48:14,958
were issued on the basis that Ronco had

7620
05:48:14,958 --> 05:48:16,680
reason to believe that its original

7621
05:48:16,680 --> 05:48:19,120
tariff Declaration was incorrect at the

7622
05:48:19,120 --> 05:48:21,958
time and and that that relates back to

7623
05:48:21,958 --> 05:48:24,360
the reassessment policy right which we

7624
05:48:24,360 --> 05:48:26,638
we say that the in the judicial review

7625
05:48:26,638 --> 05:48:30,878
that the the Das should be quashed um uh

7626
05:48:30,878 --> 05:48:33,760
because um the reassessment policy

7627
05:48:33,760 --> 05:48:36,320
requires that Ronco be excused from

7628
05:48:36,320 --> 05:48:38,878
those d ities right on the basis that it

7629
05:48:38,878 --> 05:48:40,718
did not have reason to believe at the

7630
05:48:40,718 --> 05:48:43,080
time of

7631
05:48:45,280 --> 05:48:47,920
import and it it's you know it was it

7632
05:48:47,920 --> 05:48:50,240
was unclear in those Communications as

7633
05:48:50,240 --> 05:48:53,360
to what what what uh decision we should

7634
05:48:53,360 --> 05:48:55,958
be challenging the only decision that

7635
05:48:55,958 --> 05:48:58,558
comes to Ronco is the decision of the

7636
05:48:58,558 --> 05:49:00,958
detailed adjustment statements it's not

7637
05:49:00,958 --> 05:49:02,680
as though someone you know sends a

7638
05:49:02,680 --> 05:49:04,840
letter to Ronco that says we're not

7639
05:49:04,840 --> 05:49:07,360
applying the reassessment policy

7640
05:49:07,360 --> 05:49:09,478
right or we're not applying section 27

7641
05:49:09,478 --> 05:49:12,958
of the reassessment policy

7642
05:49:14,040 --> 05:49:17,040
here

7643
05:49:20,680 --> 05:49:23,478
um so it's in it's in the context of

7644
05:49:23,478 --> 05:49:25,520
these multiple representations about

7645
05:49:25,520 --> 05:49:27,840
where re re reason to believe can be

7646
05:49:27,840 --> 05:49:29,680
dealt with and where it cannot be dealt

7647
05:49:29,680 --> 05:49:32,520
with that we say that cbsa is now a

7648
05:49:32,520 --> 05:49:35,638
stopped from taking the position that uh

7649
05:49:35,638 --> 05:49:37,320
this court doesn't have jurisdiction to

7650
05:49:37,320 --> 05:49:39,240
hear the issue and that the issue should

7651
05:49:39,240 --> 05:49:42,440
be before the CIT as a part of

7652
05:49:42,440 --> 05:49:46,840
um a challenge to the duties

7653
05:49:47,240 --> 05:49:50,400
there I will quickly touch on the issue

7654
05:49:50,400 --> 05:49:52,718
of multiplicity of proceedings which I I

7655
05:49:52,718 --> 05:49:54,718
think Justice gleon you you you've

7656
05:49:54,718 --> 05:49:57,240
you've asked about a few times but um

7657
05:49:57,240 --> 05:50:00,718
we're talking about a section 135 action

7658
05:50:00,718 --> 05:50:02,280
in federal court to challenge The

7659
05:50:02,280 --> 05:50:03,558
Minister's

7660
05:50:03,558 --> 05:50:07,558
decision um uh the and say that we would

7661
05:50:07,558 --> 05:50:10,080
need to bring a separate judicial review

7662
05:50:10,080 --> 05:50:12,400
on the basis of the legislation if we

7663
05:50:12,400 --> 05:50:14,200
wanted to challenge the amount of the

7664
05:50:14,200 --> 05:50:15,638
notice of penalty

7665
05:50:15,638 --> 05:50:18,080
assessment and and then they say that we

7666
05:50:18,080 --> 05:50:20,200
should be bringing an appeal to the CIT

7667
05:50:20,200 --> 05:50:22,680
of the July 2020 detailed adjustment

7668
05:50:22,680 --> 05:50:23,878
statements and of

7669
05:50:23,878 --> 05:50:27,320
course we're not able to seek damages in

7670
05:50:27,320 --> 05:50:29,760
any of those proceedings so they would

7671
05:50:29,760 --> 05:50:32,080
have us argue these matters in three

7672
05:50:32,080 --> 05:50:34,360
separate proceedings without Ronco being

7673
05:50:34,360 --> 05:50:37,478
able to seek the relief that uh uh that

7674
05:50:37,478 --> 05:50:40,360
it seeks in this

7675
05:50:40,520 --> 05:50:42,718
claim there's no proposal from the

7676
05:50:42,718 --> 05:50:44,680
defendants as to how to coordinate these

7677
05:50:44,680 --> 05:50:47,000
multiple proceedings I which one goes

7678
05:50:47,000 --> 05:50:49,160
first how to proceed with them

7679
05:50:49,160 --> 05:50:51,520
efficiently uh and there's no proposal

7680
05:50:51,520 --> 05:50:53,200
as to how to ensure that there are no

7681
05:50:53,200 --> 05:50:55,958
conflicting decisions uh on issues like

7682
05:50:55,958 --> 05:50:58,440
reason to believe which we say would

7683
05:50:58,440 --> 05:51:00,958
need to be dealt with in the context of

7684
05:51:00,958 --> 05:51:02,240
I mean it would need to be dealt with in

7685
05:51:02,240 --> 05:51:05,240
the context of the section 135 action it

7686
05:51:05,240 --> 05:51:06,798
would need to be dealt with to some

7687
05:51:06,798 --> 05:51:09,160
extent in the context of the negligence

7688
05:51:09,160 --> 05:51:11,920
claim and parody honey claim and

7689
05:51:11,920 --> 05:51:13,520
similarly we would also be dealing with

7690
05:51:13,520 --> 05:51:16,718
it in the CIT in query whether the CIT

7691
05:51:16,718 --> 05:51:20,478
would want to hear that issue or

7692
05:51:20,478 --> 05:51:23,080
not but I think this goes back to the

7693
05:51:23,080 --> 05:51:25,760
point about access to Justice in tazone

7694
05:51:25,760 --> 05:51:28,360
because this kind of three-headed

7695
05:51:28,360 --> 05:51:30,840
procedure only makes sense for a

7696
05:51:30,840 --> 05:51:33,798
defendant that has practically unlimited

7697
05:51:33,798 --> 05:51:36,360
resources and that wants to avoid having

7698
05:51:36,360 --> 05:51:39,878
this case heard on its merits and I I

7699
05:51:39,878 --> 05:51:41,320
took you through some of the process

7700
05:51:41,320 --> 05:51:43,718
that we went through uh Mr Baxter's

7701
05:51:43,718 --> 05:51:45,240
already made the point to that most

7702
05:51:45,240 --> 05:51:47,320
litigants would have abandoned this case

7703
05:51:47,320 --> 05:51:49,760
by now given the procedural obstacles

7704
05:51:49,760 --> 05:51:52,080
that have been created by the defendants

7705
05:51:52,080 --> 05:51:54,200
and and we and we think that the reason

7706
05:51:54,200 --> 05:51:56,400
for that is to avoid having the issues

7707
05:51:56,400 --> 05:51:58,360
in this case and that fundamental

7708
05:51:58,360 --> 05:52:01,040
question of whether Ronco was treated

7709
05:52:01,040 --> 05:52:03,280
unequally and whether that constitutes

7710
05:52:03,280 --> 05:52:05,400
negligence from having that heard on its

7711
05:52:05,400 --> 05:52:07,478
merits

7712
05:52:07,478 --> 05:52:09,600
and that we say is a serious access to

7713
05:52:09,600 --> 05:52:12,718
Justice concern just like in tazone and

7714
05:52:12,718 --> 05:52:14,478
the government should not be allowed to

7715
05:52:14,478 --> 05:52:17,080
rely on the technical and ill-founded

7716
05:52:17,080 --> 05:52:19,400
procedural arguments that they're making

7717
05:52:19,400 --> 05:52:23,040
to avoid having this her on its

7718
05:52:29,478 --> 05:52:33,120
merits I will touch on um touch on it

7719
05:52:33,120 --> 05:52:36,558
very briefly which is just the the uh

7720
05:52:36,558 --> 05:52:39,638
interpretation of reason to believe I I

7721
05:52:39,638 --> 05:52:43,680
think Mr nspac said this morning that um

7722
05:52:43,680 --> 05:52:45,400
it's not an issue that needs to be

7723
05:52:45,400 --> 05:52:48,240
finally dealt with on this motion what

7724
05:52:48,240 --> 05:52:50,240
the significance of Reason to Believe

7725
05:52:50,240 --> 05:52:52,798
within the reassessment policy is and

7726
05:52:52,798 --> 05:52:55,320
how it should be interpreted I agree

7727
05:52:55,320 --> 05:52:57,200
with him that it's not an issue for this

7728
05:52:57,200 --> 05:53:01,160
motion to strike because um it it it's

7729
05:53:01,160 --> 05:53:04,000
it's not a basis to strike Ron Go's

7730
05:53:04,000 --> 05:53:07,600
claim even if even if the defendants are

7731
05:53:07,600 --> 05:53:10,798
right about um uh what the significance

7732
05:53:10,798 --> 05:53:14,160
of reason to believe is um our claims

7733
05:53:14,160 --> 05:53:16,600
and negligence and imperity honey as

7734
05:53:16,600 --> 05:53:19,840
I've said are are broader based on the

7735
05:53:19,840 --> 05:53:22,680
conduct of cbsa and not anchored solely

7736
05:53:22,680 --> 05:53:24,798
and reason to believe which is only one

7737
05:53:24,798 --> 05:53:26,600
piece of that

7738
05:53:26,600 --> 05:53:30,478
puzzle and we disagree with uh cbsa

7739
05:53:30,478 --> 05:53:33,400
interpretation of um of reason to

7740
05:53:33,400 --> 05:53:35,920
believe we've referred to the uh

7741
05:53:35,920 --> 05:53:39,200
reassess policy which we say uh makes

7742
05:53:39,200 --> 05:53:42,280
very clear and has mandatory language

7743
05:53:42,280 --> 05:53:45,120
that Ronco is to be relieved or that a a

7744
05:53:45,120 --> 05:53:47,120
party that did not have reason to

7745
05:53:47,120 --> 05:53:49,520
believe that its declarations were

7746
05:53:49,520 --> 05:53:53,958
incorrect at the time of import um uh uh

7747
05:53:53,958 --> 05:53:58,040
uh is only required to correct for the

7748
05:53:58,040 --> 05:53:59,280
period of

7749
05:53:59,280 --> 05:54:02,040
verification and for the period going

7750
05:54:02,040 --> 05:54:05,320
forward following the amendment and I

7751
05:54:05,320 --> 05:54:06,798
think that's where we have our

7752
05:54:06,798 --> 05:54:09,040
fundamental disagreement is about what

7753
05:54:09,040 --> 05:54:12,400
going forward means and how to interpret

7754
05:54:12,400 --> 05:54:14,840
that but that's that's not a question to

7755
05:54:14,840 --> 05:54:17,040
be dealt with on this motion to strike I

7756
05:54:17,040 --> 05:54:18,760
don't think the defendants submit that

7757
05:54:18,760 --> 05:54:20,360
it's a question to be dealt with on this

7758
05:54:20,360 --> 05:54:24,160
Mo uh um on a motion to strike so I I

7759
05:54:24,160 --> 05:54:26,600
I'm not going to get into it in any more

7760
05:54:26,600 --> 05:54:29,400
detail just to say

7761
05:54:29,400 --> 05:54:31,680
that the the provisions of the

7762
05:54:31,680 --> 05:54:33,638
reassessment policy and and and just so

7763
05:54:33,638 --> 05:54:35,360
you know the reassessment policy

7764
05:54:35,360 --> 05:54:37,400
specifically

7765
05:54:37,400 --> 05:54:41,760
ties the um uh correction period to

7766
05:54:41,760 --> 05:54:44,040
reason to believe I mean that is section

7767
05:54:44,040 --> 05:54:46,760
one of the reassessment policy ties

7768
05:54:46,760 --> 05:54:49,760
those Concepts together and then section

7769
05:54:49,760 --> 05:54:52,760
27 is the section that we say has that

7770
05:54:52,760 --> 05:54:54,920
mandatory language and this is set out

7771
05:54:54,920 --> 05:54:57,240
in our written submissions but just at a

7772
05:54:57,240 --> 05:55:01,000
high level I mean it makes good sense

7773
05:55:01,000 --> 05:55:03,840
that the duties imposed on an importer

7774
05:55:03,840 --> 05:55:05,798
that didn't know that its declarations

7775
05:55:05,798 --> 05:55:08,200
were incorrect correct that didn't have

7776
05:55:08,200 --> 05:55:10,120
reason to believe that its declarations

7777
05:55:10,120 --> 05:55:12,920
were incorrect it makes good sense that

7778
05:55:12,920 --> 05:55:15,600
that importer should not be charged the

7779
05:55:15,600 --> 05:55:18,200
same retroactive duties as someone who

7780
05:55:18,200 --> 05:55:19,920
did have reason to believe at the time

7781
05:55:19,920 --> 05:55:22,558
of import and that's especially true

7782
05:55:22,558 --> 05:55:25,040
here where Ronco received advice that

7783
05:55:25,040 --> 05:55:27,680
its declarations were

7784
05:55:27,680 --> 05:55:30,478
correct Ronco was led to believe as we

7785
05:55:30,478 --> 05:55:33,080
allege that it uh could import rough

7786
05:55:33,080 --> 05:55:36,440
boore wheels under tariff 21 um uh

7787
05:55:36,440 --> 05:55:38,718
because cbsa had allowed them to do so

7788
05:55:38,718 --> 05:55:40,798
for years and it also allowed other

7789
05:55:40,798 --> 05:55:43,000
industry participants to do so for years

7790
05:55:43,000 --> 05:55:45,798
including Sumit Tomo under that advanced

7791
05:55:45,798 --> 05:55:48,760
ruling and despite all this um our view

7792
05:55:48,760 --> 05:55:50,320
is that the defendants are now saying to

7793
05:55:50,320 --> 05:55:53,280
Ronco that reason to believe has no

7794
05:55:53,280 --> 05:55:55,160
effect on Ron Go's obligation to pay

7795
05:55:55,160 --> 05:55:57,718
retroactive duties uh and we say that

7796
05:55:57,718 --> 05:56:00,558
must be wrong based on our our uh

7797
05:56:00,558 --> 05:56:02,120
interpretation of the reassessment

7798
05:56:02,120 --> 05:56:04,638
policy that that's dealt with in further

7799
05:56:04,638 --> 05:56:07,520
detail in our written missions but I

7800
05:56:07,520 --> 05:56:10,440
think I'll I'll I'll leave it at that um

7801
05:56:10,440 --> 05:56:14,478
uh uh for today um I I did want to go

7802
05:56:14,478 --> 05:56:17,080
back to the question of Duty of care

7803
05:56:17,080 --> 05:56:21,600
just very briefly and that is a that is

7804
05:56:21,600 --> 05:56:24,760
a matter whether whether a duty of care

7805
05:56:24,760 --> 05:56:27,878
can be imposed on cbsa in these kinds of

7806
05:56:27,878 --> 05:56:30,360
circumstances is absolutely a matter

7807
05:56:30,360 --> 05:56:32,638
that needs to be heard on its merits

7808
05:56:32,638 --> 05:56:34,400
because as all the parties have made

7809
05:56:34,400 --> 05:56:36,798
clear to you today there are are no

7810
05:56:36,798 --> 05:56:39,360
cases dealing with that issue there are

7811
05:56:39,360 --> 05:56:41,920
no cases that say that there is no duty

7812
05:56:41,920 --> 05:56:44,958
of care owed by um

7813
05:56:44,958 --> 05:56:49,798
cbsa uh uh to an importer in general and

7814
05:56:49,798 --> 05:56:52,680
also in circumstances such as these now

7815
05:56:52,680 --> 05:56:54,760
no case has been put forward before you

7816
05:56:54,760 --> 05:56:57,478
for that proposition so that that

7817
05:56:57,478 --> 05:57:00,320
absolutely should not be struck um we've

7818
05:57:00,320 --> 05:57:02,440
properly pled our negligence claim we've

7819
05:57:02,440 --> 05:57:05,320
properly pled our mer parody honey claim

7820
05:57:05,320 --> 05:57:07,760
we've pled private law causes of action

7821
05:57:07,760 --> 05:57:09,638
and just like in telone we should be

7822
05:57:09,638 --> 05:57:14,200
able to get on with them those are my

7823
05:57:16,120 --> 05:57:19,638
submissions thank you very much uh Mr

7824
05:57:19,638 --> 05:57:21,280

um back to the uh to the defendants a

7826
05:57:25,760 --> 05:57:28,680
reply uh we do have a brief reply I

7827
05:57:28,680 --> 05:57:30,280
wonder if we could have just five

7828
05:57:30,280 --> 05:57:32,558
minutes just to uh to briefly make sure

7829
05:57:32,558 --> 05:57:34,160
that we have everything in order

7830
05:57:34,160 --> 05:57:37,200
certainly yeah so um so we'll adjourn

7831
05:57:37,200 --> 05:57:38,920
then till uh

7832
05:57:38,920 --> 05:57:43,920

everybody back so uh Mr

7836
05:57:53,520 --> 05:57:55,920
nospam uh thank you justice gleon I'll

7837
05:57:55,920 --> 05:57:58,520
be very brief um most of the submissions

7838
05:57:58,520 --> 05:58:00,638
of my friends uh we address in our in

7839
05:58:00,638 --> 05:58:02,718
our main submissions I'll just go

7840
05:58:02,718 --> 05:58:05,520
through a number of points um first my

7841
05:58:05,520 --> 05:58:08,080
friend both of my friends uh mentioned

7842
05:58:08,080 --> 05:58:10,240
the novelty aspect and suggested that

7843
05:58:10,240 --> 05:58:12,520
this claim should not be struck because

7844
05:58:12,520 --> 05:58:14,558
of novelty and I just wanted to make it

7845
05:58:14,558 --> 05:58:15,600
clear

7846
05:58:15,600 --> 05:58:18,120
that we are not asking that it be struck

7847
05:58:18,120 --> 05:58:20,760
because of novelty uh that is not one of

7848
05:58:20,760 --> 05:58:22,558
our grounds um

7849
05:58:22,558 --> 05:58:25,958
it novelty was raised in the context of

7850
05:58:25,958 --> 05:58:28,360
uh the negligence uh duty of care

7851
05:58:28,360 --> 05:58:31,000
exercise which was just to say that no

7852
05:58:31,000 --> 05:58:33,798
previous case has dealt with with duty

7853
05:58:33,798 --> 05:58:35,798
of care in this scenario and all that

7854
05:58:35,798 --> 05:58:37,920
means means is that the full test has to

7855
05:58:37,920 --> 05:58:41,798
be looked at um my friend Mr Baer says

7856
05:58:41,798 --> 05:58:43,638
well these are arguments you can make at

7857
05:58:43,638 --> 05:58:46,080
trial uh all of the arguments that one

7858
05:58:46,080 --> 05:58:48,360
could make on a motion to strike could

7859
05:58:48,360 --> 05:58:51,920
also be made at trial by definition um

7860
05:58:51,920 --> 05:58:53,120
that doesn't mean that a motion to

7861
05:58:53,120 --> 05:58:56,040
strike is not appropriate uh and in the

7862
05:58:56,040 --> 05:58:58,360
context of the duty of care analysis my

7863
05:58:58,360 --> 05:59:00,200
friend Mr Baxter says that all of these

7864
05:59:00,200 --> 05:59:03,320
duty of care cases went to trial uh well

7865
05:59:03,320 --> 05:59:06,638
I would point out that the Almon case at

7866
05:59:06,638 --> 05:59:08,638
uh tab eight of our book did not go to

7867
05:59:08,638 --> 05:59:10,558
trial it was struck on the duty of care

7868
05:59:10,558 --> 05:59:13,160
issue on a motion to strike as was the

7869
05:59:13,160 --> 05:59:16,600
swarth case uh which is at tab 51 of our

7870
05:59:16,600 --> 05:59:19,878
book and as was what my friend I'm sure

7871
05:59:19,878 --> 05:59:22,080
will agree is one of the big cases

7872
05:59:22,080 --> 05:59:23,958
Imperial tobacco itself was about a

7873
05:59:23,958 --> 05:59:27,280
motion to strike which was struck on the

7874
05:59:27,280 --> 05:59:29,680
basis of lack of Duty of care including

7875
05:59:29,680 --> 05:59:32,040
on the second stage of that

7876
05:59:32,040 --> 05:59:35,600
test um I also want to clarify uh that

7877
05:59:35,600 --> 05:59:38,160
we are not suggesting that the

7878
05:59:38,160 --> 05:59:39,958
plaintiffs can pursue their Claim by way

7879
05:59:39,958 --> 05:59:41,718
of a judicial review just in case there

7880
05:59:41,718 --> 05:59:44,440
was any confusion in that

7881
05:59:44,440 --> 05:59:47,200
respect um I'd like to just brief my

7882
05:59:47,200 --> 05:59:50,400
friend said that uh surrounding the

7883
05:59:50,400 --> 05:59:53,680
notion of a uh Advanced ruling and the

7884
05:59:53,680 --> 05:59:56,600
sumomo situation that it

7885
05:59:56,600 --> 06:00:00,478
was a question of of contributory

7886
06:00:00,478 --> 06:00:03,240
negligence that the plaintiff did not

7887
06:00:03,240 --> 06:00:06,558
Avail themselves of an advanced rule

7888
06:00:06,558 --> 06:00:08,478
we would submit that uh it is not a

7889
06:00:08,478 --> 06:00:11,000
matter of negligence at all it is we

7890
06:00:11,000 --> 06:00:12,520
just said that it was open to the

7891
06:00:12,520 --> 06:00:14,840
plaintiff to seek an advanced ruling

7892
06:00:14,840 --> 06:00:17,000
what it is about is the application of

7893
06:00:17,000 --> 06:00:18,000
the

7894
06:00:18,000 --> 06:00:20,080
legislation which is both the Customs

7895
06:00:20,080 --> 06:00:22,120
Act and the regulations pertaining to

7896
06:00:22,120 --> 06:00:24,160
Advanced

7897
06:00:24,160 --> 06:00:28,638
rulings the any any um differential

7898
06:00:28,638 --> 06:00:30,958
treatment coming out of that is as a

7899
06:00:30,958 --> 06:00:33,638
result of the application of the

7900
06:00:33,638 --> 06:00:36,240
legislation as it's written and and as

7901
06:00:36,240 --> 06:00:40,000
it and as it is this is in no way

7902
06:00:40,000 --> 06:00:43,040
comparable to Ron Kelli versus D dup C

7903
06:00:43,040 --> 06:00:46,040
where the whole point of that case was

7904
06:00:46,040 --> 06:00:50,320
uh the bad faith and

7905
06:00:50,760 --> 06:00:52,958
arbitrariness of the premier of Quebec

7906
06:00:52,958 --> 06:00:55,400
and intervening to to to personally

7907
06:00:55,400 --> 06:00:58,478
remove the license from from the plti

7908
06:00:58,478 --> 06:01:01,478
there

7909
06:01:02,680 --> 06:01:05,558
um my friend referred to referred

7910
06:01:05,558 --> 06:01:07,878
several times that the case is on all

7911
06:01:07,878 --> 06:01:10,840
fours factually with tazone and we just

7912
06:01:10,840 --> 06:01:12,360
say that there's three ways in which it

7913
06:01:12,360 --> 06:01:14,320
isn't in particular one is the one that

7914
06:01:14,320 --> 06:01:16,400
you mentioned Justice gleon that it that

7915
06:01:16,400 --> 06:01:19,638
case didn't involve statutory scheme

7916
06:01:19,638 --> 06:01:22,520
second it did not involve damages that

7917
06:01:22,520 --> 06:01:25,360
that are in the nature of of of taxes

7918
06:01:25,360 --> 06:01:28,040
seeking reimbursement of taxes as

7919
06:01:28,040 --> 06:01:31,040
damages and third the the the plaintiffs

7920
06:01:31,040 --> 06:01:34,040
in that case did not seek to nullify the

7921
06:01:34,040 --> 06:01:36,840
effect of the decision that issue

7922
06:01:36,840 --> 06:01:40,120
plaintiffs are in this case uh they're

7923
06:01:40,120 --> 06:01:42,360
trying to undo what was

7924
06:01:42,360 --> 06:01:48,638
done um the next point I had is on uh

7925
06:01:49,440 --> 06:01:51,478
jurisdiction uh I just want to make it

7926
06:01:51,478 --> 06:01:54,638
clear that uh my my friend Mr traso said

7927
06:01:54,638 --> 06:01:56,680
that we are not making an argument that

7928
06:01:56,680 --> 06:01:59,440
the negligence claim or the parody honey

7929
06:01:59,440 --> 06:02:01,680
claim are outside of this Court's

7930
06:02:01,680 --> 06:02:03,798
Jurisdiction we certainly say they are

7931
06:02:03,798 --> 06:02:05,400
outside of this jurisdiction with

7932
06:02:05,400 --> 06:02:08,440
respect to the damages related to duties

7933
06:02:08,440 --> 06:02:09,280
and

7934
06:02:09,280 --> 06:02:11,120
interest we've already made our

7935
06:02:11,120 --> 06:02:14,360
submissions on parody honey as a whole

7936
06:02:14,360 --> 06:02:16,600
um uh but in that context of that

7937
06:02:16,600 --> 06:02:18,240
discussion my friend said that there

7938
06:02:18,240 --> 06:02:21,400
we've shown given no cases uh to say the

7939
06:02:21,400 --> 06:02:24,558
court cannot Grant the sorts of Damages

7940
06:02:24,558 --> 06:02:27,360
here regarding the duties and I would

7941
06:02:27,360 --> 06:02:29,040
just take the remind the court again

7942
06:02:29,040 --> 06:02:32,878
that we took uh us to the the flar case

7943
06:02:32,878 --> 06:02:36,120
which is at tab 18 of our book

7944
06:02:36,120 --> 06:02:39,760
and the veridico case which is at 53

7945
06:02:39,760 --> 06:02:42,558
both of those cases involves um money

7946
06:02:42,558 --> 06:02:45,958
well verich was taxes Flo was seized

7947
06:02:45,958 --> 06:02:48,878
funds which rather than following the

7948
06:02:48,878 --> 06:02:50,718
the appropriate scheme were sought as

7949
06:02:50,718 --> 06:02:53,478
damages and the

7950
06:02:53,478 --> 06:02:57,080
court struck those

7951
06:02:57,478 --> 06:03:00,120
claims

7952
06:03:00,120 --> 06:03:03,240
um just in terms of I I just have to

7953
06:03:03,240 --> 06:03:06,478
reiterate that in terms of uh the cit's

7954
06:03:06,478 --> 06:03:08,878
jurisdiction my friend's assertion again

7955
06:03:08,878 --> 06:03:12,080
that that the the CIT on a section 67

7956
06:03:12,080 --> 06:03:14,080
appeal is limited to the issues of

7957
06:03:14,080 --> 06:03:17,040
tariff classification value for Duty uh

7958
06:03:17,040 --> 06:03:18,320
and

7959
06:03:18,320 --> 06:03:20,558
origin that statement can only be made

7960
06:03:20,558 --> 06:03:22,080
if one ignores all of the federal court

7961
06:03:22,080 --> 06:03:24,878
of appeal federal court and cic CIT

7962
06:03:24,878 --> 06:03:27,040
decisions that we took you to today my

7963
06:03:27,040 --> 06:03:28,600
friend says the only thing outside of

7964
06:03:28,600 --> 06:03:30,400
that so there is something outside of

7965
06:03:30,400 --> 06:03:33,360
that is is challenging the validity of a

7966
06:03:33,360 --> 06:03:35,558
Das it says they're not trying to do

7967
06:03:35,558 --> 06:03:36,718
that

7968
06:03:36,718 --> 06:03:39,878
here we disagree they're saying that the

7969
06:03:39,878 --> 06:03:42,400
the D is not valid because they didn't

7970
06:03:42,400 --> 06:03:44,040
actually have reason to believe and

7971
06:03:44,040 --> 06:03:47,040
because the policies of the cbsa were

7972
06:03:47,040 --> 06:03:49,080
misapplied basically as my friend

7973
06:03:49,080 --> 06:03:50,878
described in relation to the the

7974
06:03:50,878 --> 06:03:53,440
judicial review application that they

7975
06:03:53,440 --> 06:03:54,840
have held in OB

7976
06:03:54,840 --> 06:03:57,240
bance uh and of course jockey dealt with

7977
06:03:57,240 --> 06:03:58,840
the issue with the

7978
06:03:58,840 --> 06:04:02,840
CIT as I noted um I won't go into again

7979
06:04:02,840 --> 06:04:06,000
to our disagreements with uh my friend

7980
06:04:06,000 --> 06:04:07,798
on the jockey cases and how they are to

7981
06:04:07,798 --> 06:04:10,600
be interpreted I I tried to address that

7982
06:04:10,600 --> 06:04:14,478
in my submissions in Chief um I I I just

7983
06:04:14,478 --> 06:04:16,360
urge you to read the jockey cases

7984
06:04:16,360 --> 06:04:19,400
particularly the CIT one carefully uh to

7985
06:04:19,400 --> 06:04:21,718
see that the CIT did in fact deal with

7986
06:04:21,718 --> 06:04:23,840
the issues that it had to and did not

7987
06:04:23,840 --> 06:04:26,280
shy away from

7988
06:04:26,280 --> 06:04:29,840
it um finally I would just say that my

7989
06:04:29,840 --> 06:04:31,200
friend

7990
06:04:31,200 --> 06:04:34,360
uh questioned whether the CIT could even

7991
06:04:34,360 --> 06:04:36,638
award the duties

7992
06:04:36,638 --> 06:04:39,200
uh if they were successful and I would

7993
06:04:39,200 --> 06:04:41,280
just say that if the Das is if they are

7994
06:04:41,280 --> 06:04:43,600
successful at the CIT that means that

7995
06:04:43,600 --> 06:04:45,240
the D is

7996
06:04:45,240 --> 06:04:48,280
overturned and that means that the cbsa

7997
06:04:48,280 --> 06:04:51,920
returns the duties or cancels the duties

7998
06:04:51,920 --> 06:04:54,000
as

7999
06:04:54,000 --> 06:04:57,080
owing and of course the CIT proceeding

8000
06:04:57,080 --> 06:04:57,920
is a

8001
06:04:57,920 --> 06:05:02,040
denovo hearing at which evidence can be

8002
06:05:02,040 --> 06:05:05,080
uh can can be adduced uh so when my

8003
06:05:05,080 --> 06:05:06,878
friend says that we are trying to

8004
06:05:06,878 --> 06:05:09,200
prevent this case from seeing light of

8005
06:05:09,200 --> 06:05:12,400
day that is in fact not the case at

8006
06:05:12,400 --> 06:05:15,000
all uh those subject questions those are

8007
06:05:15,000 --> 06:05:16,558
my reply

8008
06:05:16,558 --> 06:05:20,320
submissions no I have no no further

8009
06:05:20,320 --> 06:05:23,478
questions thank

8010
06:05:23,718 --> 06:05:27,400
you all right I think that wraps up then

8011
06:05:27,400 --> 06:05:30,040
the submissions for this afternoon uh I

8012
06:05:30,040 --> 06:05:33,600
would like to hear very briefly um on

8013
06:05:33,600 --> 06:05:36,360
the issue of costs as I indicated this

8014
06:05:36,360 --> 06:05:38,798
morning and specifically cost thrown

8015
06:05:38,798 --> 06:05:40,360
away I have your written submissions

8016
06:05:40,360 --> 06:05:44,120
I've been through them um certainly uh

8017
06:05:44,120 --> 06:05:46,600
the the defendants do address this whole

8018
06:05:46,600 --> 06:05:48,520
issue of the timing and whether or not

8019
06:05:48,520 --> 06:05:51,760
uh costs in the amounts and in the uh

8020
06:05:51,760 --> 06:05:53,558
the volume of work that's reflected in

8021
06:05:53,558 --> 06:05:55,958
the uh in the plan of submissions are

8022
06:05:55,958 --> 06:05:58,400
really thrown away given uh given where

8023
06:05:58,400 --> 06:06:02,400
we are from a Time perspective and uh

8024
06:06:02,400 --> 06:06:04,958
again I'll leave you the opportunity Mr

8025
06:06:04,958 --> 06:06:06,080
backer if you'd like to make any

8026
06:06:06,080 --> 06:06:09,040
submissions on that aspect of things

8027
06:06:09,040 --> 06:06:10,718
otherwise I'll deal with this in the in

8028
06:06:10,718 --> 06:06:13,400
the context of uh of the order that

8029
06:06:13,400 --> 06:06:15,718
issues in the uh in the motion itself

8030
06:06:15,718 --> 06:06:17,280
but uh but I just wanted to give you the

8031
06:06:17,280 --> 06:06:18,680
opportunity if you want to speak to the

8032
06:06:18,680 --> 06:06:20,920
issue and obviously give the defendants

8033
06:06:20,920 --> 06:06:22,840
the opportunity to respond if if there's

8034
06:06:22,840 --> 06:06:25,920
anything to respond to so thank you

8035
06:06:25,920 --> 06:06:27,680
justice gleon and I'll be extremely

8036
06:06:27,680 --> 06:06:30,200
brief and uh I am going to invite my

8037
06:06:30,200 --> 06:06:33,200
friend Mr triviso to talk to speak to

8038
06:06:33,200 --> 06:06:35,240
the case law which was submitted in our

8039
06:06:35,240 --> 06:06:38,600
three page uh in our three-page item

8040
06:06:38,600 --> 06:06:41,600
just three remarks first of all Ronco is

8041
06:06:41,600 --> 06:06:43,600
thankful to the court for rescheduling

8042
06:06:43,600 --> 06:06:46,600
this matter so quickly uh we heard I

8043
06:06:46,600 --> 06:06:48,638
think it's three weeks and a day from

8044
06:06:48,638 --> 06:06:50,200
the time that we were initially supposed

8045
06:06:50,200 --> 06:06:54,558
to be heard um just a remark that is

8046
06:06:54,558 --> 06:06:58,320
three weeks is still a very long time um

8047
06:06:58,320 --> 06:07:00,120
particularly for all of us when we have

8048
06:07:00,120 --> 06:07:03,280
intervening cases my second General

8049
06:07:03,280 --> 06:07:05,200
remark is that the as I understand the

8050
06:07:05,200 --> 06:07:07,718
jur Prudence costs thrown away are very

8051
06:07:07,718 --> 06:07:11,558
real cost paid by real clients and

8052
06:07:11,558 --> 06:07:13,680
that's what happened in this case not

8053
06:07:13,680 --> 06:07:17,240
once but twice and at the instance of a

8054
06:07:17,240 --> 06:07:20,718
party on its own motion uh we don't take

8055
06:07:20,718 --> 06:07:24,478
we don't uh it cost there's not blame uh

8056
06:07:24,478 --> 06:07:26,440
affiliated with cost thrown away and my

8057
06:07:26,440 --> 06:07:28,638
friend will speak to that uh but it

8058
06:07:28,638 --> 06:07:31,638
happened not once but twice and third uh

8059
06:07:31,638 --> 06:07:33,400
and this probably speaks more to my old

8060
06:07:33,400 --> 06:07:36,840
and fuzzy brain compared what uh the

8061
06:07:36,840 --> 06:07:39,600
others other Council but there was a

8062
06:07:39,600 --> 06:07:41,440
great deal of time in getting back up to

8063
06:07:41,440 --> 06:07:44,000
speed this past week I will tell you my

8064
06:07:44,000 --> 06:07:46,440
friends the Attorney General um have you

8065
06:07:46,440 --> 06:07:49,478
know ably relied upon 47 different

8066
06:07:49,478 --> 06:07:52,638
pieces of jurist prudence cases um six

8067
06:07:52,638 --> 06:07:55,520
or seven statutory regimes that took a

8068
06:07:55,520 --> 06:07:57,760
great deal of time and none of it came

8069
06:07:57,760 --> 06:08:00,240
back easily but I would like now to ask

8070
06:08:00,240 --> 06:08:02,920
Mr trevisano if he would um just speak

8071
06:08:02,920 --> 06:08:06,080
to the the the legal tests in the case

8072
06:08:06,080 --> 06:08:09,558
thank you thank

8073
06:08:17,798 --> 06:08:22,040
you so just just briefly um the case law

8074
06:08:22,040 --> 06:08:24,040
that we've cited in our cost submissions

8075
06:08:24,040 --> 06:08:26,680
makes clear that costs thrown away

8076
06:08:26,680 --> 06:08:29,760
should be treated on a lumsum basis on

8077
06:08:29,760 --> 06:08:32,000
the basis of the actual costs incurred

8078
06:08:32,000 --> 06:08:34,320
and not on the basis of the tariffs

8079
06:08:34,320 --> 06:08:37,600
we've cited to the Abdul razic case the

8080
06:08:37,600 --> 06:08:41,558
Packers plus case and the Eli Lily case

8081
06:08:41,558 --> 06:08:43,840
uh all all three in the federal court

8082
06:08:43,840 --> 06:08:45,120
and they're cited in our cost

8083
06:08:45,120 --> 06:08:48,120
submissions and I understand in Abdul

8084
06:08:48,120 --> 06:08:50,400
razik and Packers plus those are both

8085
06:08:50,400 --> 06:08:52,760
cases dealing with trials and I I

8086
06:08:52,760 --> 06:08:54,400
understand that and I understand that

8087
06:08:54,400 --> 06:08:55,958
the amount of preparation that goes into

8088
06:08:55,958 --> 06:08:58,520
a trial is very significant but I think

8089
06:08:58,520 --> 06:09:01,120
that the principle of treating this from

8090
06:09:01,120 --> 06:09:04,280
a lumpsum basis should be the same in

8091
06:09:04,280 --> 06:09:07,280
the context of a though maybe the amount

8092
06:09:07,280 --> 06:09:09,958
of preparation involved in a motion is

8093
06:09:09,958 --> 06:09:12,080
less and that can be reflected in how

8094
06:09:12,080 --> 06:09:14,440
you exercise your discretion to give us

8095
06:09:14,440 --> 06:09:17,080
a portion of those costs thrown away it

8096
06:09:17,080 --> 06:09:20,280
is the very same principle in that we

8097
06:09:20,280 --> 06:09:23,558
prepared we got ramped up twice for this

8098
06:09:23,558 --> 06:09:26,240
proceeding uh and have had to do so now

8099
06:09:26,240 --> 06:09:29,878
a third time uh which involves as Mr Mr

8100
06:09:29,878 --> 06:09:33,400
bter uh reference and it's it's it's not

8101
06:09:33,400 --> 06:09:35,000
his brain not just his brain but my

8102
06:09:35,000 --> 06:09:38,000
brain to and trying to get back into

8103
06:09:38,000 --> 06:09:41,040
these 53 cases um I would just speak

8104
06:09:41,040 --> 06:09:43,478
quickly to the Eli Lily case which makes

8105
06:09:43,478 --> 06:09:46,000
clear that the standard here in

8106
06:09:46,000 --> 06:09:49,440
assessing whether um or or whether cost

8107
06:09:49,440 --> 06:09:52,120
thrown away should be assessed on a

8108
06:09:52,120 --> 06:09:55,080
lumpsum basis it's not a matter of

8109
06:09:55,080 --> 06:09:57,760
reprehensible scandalous or outrageous

8110
06:09:57,760 --> 06:10:01,320
conduct as my friend suggest in in Eli

8111
06:10:01,320 --> 06:10:05,040
Lily OD issue was a an examination that

8112
06:10:05,040 --> 06:10:08,240
was adjourn due to a last minute illness

8113
06:10:08,240 --> 06:10:11,000
um uh these costs rewarding costs thrown

8114
06:10:11,000 --> 06:10:13,440
away on a lumsum basis is not meant to

8115
06:10:13,440 --> 06:10:15,320
be punitive it's just meant to

8116
06:10:15,320 --> 06:10:17,920
compensate for the real the real costs

8117
06:10:17,920 --> 06:10:20,160
incurred and the way we've Quant

8118
06:10:20,160 --> 06:10:22,600
Quantified our total costs in the

8119
06:10:22,600 --> 06:10:25,280
submissions i i i acknowledge that it's

8120
06:10:25,280 --> 06:10:27,280
significant and there was significant

8121
06:10:27,280 --> 06:10:29,400
preparation involved for both of those

8122
06:10:29,400 --> 06:10:31,760
hearings we've presented you with the

8123
06:10:31,760 --> 06:10:33,878
total lumpsum amount uh that was

8124
06:10:33,878 --> 06:10:36,520
incurred in preparing for the ing twice

8125
06:10:36,520 --> 06:10:38,280
and I would submit Justice gleon that

8126
06:10:38,280 --> 06:10:40,600
you you of course now have uh the

8127
06:10:40,600 --> 06:10:43,558
discretion to determine uh what what the

8128
06:10:43,558 --> 06:10:47,600
appropriate uh percentage of that is um

8129
06:10:47,600 --> 06:10:48,958
given given your views of the

8130
06:10:48,958 --> 06:10:51,280
circumstances the amount of time between

8131
06:10:51,280 --> 06:10:53,400
each of the adjournments I I would just

8132
06:10:53,400 --> 06:10:55,478
make one one last submission and that's

8133
06:10:55,478 --> 06:10:57,638
on the preparation for the September

8134
06:10:57,638 --> 06:11:00,840
hearing I I recognize that we we agreed

8135
06:11:00,840 --> 06:11:03,200
to that adjournment and we agreed to

8136
06:11:03,200 --> 06:11:05,360
that adjournment assuming that you know

8137
06:11:05,360 --> 06:11:07,120
the case wouldn't be the motion wouldn't

8138
06:11:07,120 --> 06:11:10,798
be adjourned again um but I I think some

8139
06:11:10,798 --> 06:11:13,958
portion of those September costs needs

8140
06:11:13,958 --> 06:11:16,520
to be included because those really are

8141
06:11:16,520 --> 06:11:18,120
costs thrown away at this point when

8142
06:11:18,120 --> 06:11:20,120
we're talking about preparation that Mr

8143
06:11:20,120 --> 06:11:22,878
baxer and I did uh a number of months

8144
06:11:22,878 --> 06:11:24,680
ago we're not just talking about three

8145
06:11:24,680 --> 06:11:29,160
weeks we're talking about um I I I I

8146
06:11:29,160 --> 06:11:30,920
guess it's uh I guess it's about three

8147
06:11:30,920 --> 06:11:33,718
months now so that's those those are my

8148
06:11:33,718 --> 06:11:37,638
submissions uh on costs thrown away can

8149
06:11:37,638 --> 06:11:40,040
I just ask you to to either yourself or

8150
06:11:40,040 --> 06:11:42,400
Mr Baxter I'm looking at your Annex H

8151
06:11:42,400 --> 06:11:44,600
your

8152
06:11:44,878 --> 06:11:47,958
submissions and I'm looking at the uh at

8153
06:11:47,958 --> 06:11:50,040
the hours I just want to make sure that

8154
06:11:50,040 --> 06:11:52,440
I understand or haven't misapprehended

8155
06:11:52,440 --> 06:11:55,478
what's happened here um the September

8156
06:11:55,478 --> 06:11:57,360
27th hearing

8157
06:11:57,360 --> 06:12:00,958
hours uh are roughly half of in fact

8158
06:12:00,958 --> 06:12:04,200
exactly half uh with respect to uh in

8159
06:12:04,200 --> 06:12:06,638
one case and and almost exactly half in

8160
06:12:06,638 --> 06:12:08,400
the other with respect to yourself and

8161
06:12:08,400 --> 06:12:11,558
Mr Baxter uh as they relate to the no

8162
06:12:11,558 --> 06:12:12,478
November

8163
06:12:12,478 --> 06:12:15,200
25 preparation

8164
06:12:15,200 --> 06:12:19,320
time is there is that is is are we

8165
06:12:19,320 --> 06:12:22,440
double counting here by by mistake or or

8166
06:12:22,440 --> 06:12:25,558
is that uh is that in fact uh what's

8167
06:12:25,558 --> 06:12:27,798
occurred here that the the prep time is

8168
06:12:27,798 --> 06:12:30,200
is double for the November 25 hearing as

8169
06:12:30,200 --> 06:12:32,878
it was for the September 27 hearing and

8170
06:12:32,878 --> 06:12:34,040
again I'm not asking to explain the

8171
06:12:34,040 --> 06:12:35,920
hours I just want to make sure

8172
06:12:35,920 --> 06:12:38,760
understand what's what's occurred there

8173
06:12:38,760 --> 06:12:42,080
that that is that is actual yes um and

8174
06:12:42,080 --> 06:12:43,840
it was significantly more time in

8175
06:12:43,840 --> 06:12:46,000
preparation for November 25th there

8176
06:12:46,000 --> 06:12:48,440
there's a few reasons uh one in

8177
06:12:48,440 --> 06:12:51,320
September uh we hadn't gotten as far in

8178
06:12:51,320 --> 06:12:52,958
terms of our preparation because there

8179
06:12:52,958 --> 06:12:56,080
was a weekend between when the hearing

8180
06:12:56,080 --> 06:12:58,360
was adjourned on a Friday and when the

8181
06:12:58,360 --> 06:13:00,040
hearing was scheduled for a Monday so we

8182
06:13:00,040 --> 06:13:02,160
anticipated significant prep time over

8183
06:13:02,160 --> 06:13:04,718
that weekend uh and I think the other

8184
06:13:04,718 --> 06:13:06,400
the other issue is there have been a

8185
06:13:06,400 --> 06:13:10,200
number of cases raised in the interim uh

8186
06:13:10,200 --> 06:13:12,798
the um the decision in the Supreme Court

8187
06:13:12,798 --> 06:13:15,360
the Tellis decision in the federal court

8188
06:13:15,360 --> 06:13:17,760
um uh I can't remember if Sketchers was

8189
06:13:17,760 --> 06:13:19,280
raised before or after the September

8190
06:13:19,280 --> 06:13:22,000
hearing but I and that's fine as I say

8191
06:13:22,000 --> 06:13:24,040
it was just just given given the the way

8192
06:13:24,040 --> 06:13:25,440
the hours were set up I just wanted to

8193
06:13:25,440 --> 06:13:28,400
make sure that uh that there wasn't a

8194
06:13:28,400 --> 06:13:30,440
clerical error there or a Mis

8195
06:13:30,440 --> 06:13:32,400
misstatement clerically all right thank

8196
06:13:32,400 --> 06:13:36,080
you very much uh Mr trano um Mr noban or

8197
06:13:36,080 --> 06:13:37,478
Mr Mayor I don't know if who's going to

8198
06:13:37,478 --> 06:13:40,478
speak to the issue on your side uh sure

8199
06:13:40,478 --> 06:13:42,240
thank you justice gleon I mean we don't

8200
06:13:42,240 --> 06:13:43,360
we don't have a lot to add to our

8201
06:13:43,360 --> 06:13:44,878
written submissions and I don't intend

8202
06:13:44,878 --> 06:13:46,160
to go through them all I don't think

8203
06:13:46,160 --> 06:13:49,200
unless you want me to no there's no

8204
06:13:49,200 --> 06:13:52,320
need I would just say that one case that

8205
06:13:52,320 --> 06:13:54,638
deals with that timeline issue that you

8206
06:13:54,638 --> 06:13:57,718
asked about is the TAA case and in that

8207
06:13:57,718 --> 06:14:00,080
case um the argument was made that well

8208
06:14:00,080 --> 06:14:02,200
some of the some of the preparation

8209
06:14:02,200 --> 06:14:04,000
isn't really thrown away it can it can

8210
06:14:04,000 --> 06:14:08,520
go forward and uh the court found that

8211
06:14:08,520 --> 06:14:10,200
it understood that argument but given

8212
06:14:10,200 --> 06:14:12,798
the seven months in that case that went

8213
06:14:12,798 --> 06:14:15,558
between the uh the adjourned hearing and

8214
06:14:15,558 --> 06:14:18,240
the actual hearing uh that that it was

8215
06:14:18,240 --> 06:14:20,760
going to order costs thrown away and it

8216
06:14:20,760 --> 06:14:24,280
did so in accordance with column four of

8217
06:14:24,280 --> 06:14:27,000
tariff and so we do think that three

8218
06:14:27,000 --> 06:14:30,160
weeks uh is brief enough time that we

8219
06:14:30,160 --> 06:14:31,760
can't say that the costs have fully been

8220
06:14:31,760 --> 06:14:34,520
thrown away and that as we say in our

8221
06:14:34,520 --> 06:14:35,760
submissions

8222
06:14:35,760 --> 06:14:37,958
they should be awarded in accordance

8223
06:14:37,958 --> 06:14:41,200
with ter thank you thank you very

8224
06:14:41,200 --> 06:14:43,840
much all right I don't have any further

8225
06:14:43,840 --> 06:14:46,600
questions um just before we wrap up just

8226
06:14:46,600 --> 06:14:48,040

8227
06:14:48,040 --> 06:14:50,000
