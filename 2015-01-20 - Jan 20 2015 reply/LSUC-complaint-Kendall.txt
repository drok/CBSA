I believe A KENDALL has misrepresented the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act in order to obtain a payment of 1606.97 from me.
This act contravenes sec. 380 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46., dealing with fraud.

On Oct 21, 2014, a CBSA officer seized currency in form of gold coins from me on the justification that it is goods subject to the Customs Act.

On Oct 23, 2014, after consulting an attorney, who concluded the seizure was wrongful, I submitted a request for appeal through the CBSA's recourse directorate online form, including references to the US Mint statement that shows my coins were indeed currency.

On Nov 3, 2014, A KENDALL from the CBSA responded to my request, and in her initial letter she lied, claiming that the PCMLTFA  includes a definition of currency, which purportedly excludes gold coins. She did not include a reference to a specific section of the PCMLTFA. The PCMLTFA does not include such a definition.

On Nov 6, 2014, I replied, requesting specific and explicit reference to the section of PCMLTFA that KENDALL was invoking.

On Dec 11, 2014, in her reply, KENDALL admitted that the PCMLTFA does not contain a definition of currency.

The purpose of the lie is to convince me to pay a $1606.97 penalty for not reporting currency under non-reporting clause in section 12 of the Customs Act.

I have also submitted to KENDALL the following documentation that proves my money is exempt from the Customs Act, as all currency is. While she acknowledged receipt of these documents, she ignored them entirely by not providing a single explanation why. Instead, she substituted her own initial opinon that "gold coins are collectible", which later she changed to "gold coins are commodities" as justification why the money should have been reported.

- Currency Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-52. - defines Canadian currency
- US Code Title 31 section 5112 which explicitly lists my coins as currency of the United States.
- US Public Law 109-145, which amended Title 31, which authorizes my gold coins as currency, dated Dec 22, 2005, also known as the "Presidential $1 Coin Act"
- Excise Act R.S.C., 1985 c. E-15, Part IX, section 123(1), which explicitly lists gold coins as currency and thus financial instruments, and therefore exempt from Customs Act.
- Sworn Affidavit from the Minister of Finance, clarifying that the Canadian gold coins issued by the Royal Canadian Mint are also currency and explicitly clarifying that they are exempt from tax as per the Excise Act


I believe her lie about the the PCMLTFA defining currency is illegal

I believe her holding personal opinion ahead of current laws is biased and incompatible with the Adjudicator Code of Conduct.


I am sending

- correspondence about the case that proves A KENDALL's fraud
- Minister of Finance sworn and signed affidavit

What I hope will happen
- LSUC will review whether A KENDALLs behaviour as an adjudicator is consistent with the LSUC's standards and the Adjudicator Code of Conduct
- LSUC will take any corrective measures it finds appropriate, like retraining, re-certification of A KENDALL as adjudicator
- LSUC will inform the A KENDALL's employer, the CBSA through the President of the CBSA, of your findings.
- The CBSA will reassign a law-abiding adjudicator to handle my wrongful seizure case.
- The CBSA will decide whether A KENDALL fits the requirements of public service, given your findings.
