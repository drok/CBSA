CanLII - 1996 CanLII 11534 (FCA) Vixs vs Nidek

The Rules are clear that pleadings are to contain the material facts, and only the material facts,
upon which the parties rely. Where the nature of the amendments is clear, there is no requirement to
plead the evidence by which those facts are to be proved. See de Korompay v. Ontario Hydro (1990),
34 C.P.R. (3d) 168 (F.C.T.D.). In determining whether an amendment to a defence should be
allowed, it is often helpful for the Court to ask itself whether the amendment, if it was already part of
the proposed pleadings, would be a plea capable of being struck out under Rule 419. If yes, the
amendment should not be allowed. See, for example, Chrysler Canada Ltd. v. The Queen, [1978] 1
F.C. 137 (T.D.). Procedurally, the Court will not receive any evidence where the basis for striking out
paragraphs in a statement of defence is alleged to be that they disclose no reasonable defence [Rule
419(1)(a)]. Rule 419(2) expressly prohibits the use of evidence on a Rule 419(1)(a) motion. In
similar fashion, the Court should not accept any evidence in support of an application for leave to
amend pleadings under Rule 420, unless evidence is required in order to clarify the nature of the
proposed amendments. Rather, the Court must assume that the facts pleaded in the amendments are
true for the purposes of considering whether or not to grant leave to amend.
